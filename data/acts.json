                "text": "Act I: Dawn's Reckoning\n\nHe’d been three days out of Ashford when he smelled the smoke—the wrong kind, not hearth-fire or forge-smoke but the flat, mineral bite of stone that had changed its mind about being stone. He’d been heading nowhere in particular, the way a man does when the war is over and the shape of peacetime hasn’t settled yet. A hedge-knight’s work: a missing horse here, a disputed boundary there. Small things. Useful things. Things that didn’t ask him to be more than he was.\n\nThen the smoke.\n\nThornwick still smoked when Caelin rode in at first light.\n\nAsh muffled the cobbles, the horse’s hooves swallowed by the soft texture and depth of the soot-packed street. Melted stone and hot glass mingling with the acrid bite of charred timber. Houses hadn't burned so much as slumped: wooden beams turned translucent, doorframes sagging into glossy curves, window mullions weeping clear droplets that froze mid-fall. Even the lane stones had softened and set again, their surfaces ridged like cooled lava.\n\nHe'd seen dragonfire before—in the war, villages reduced to char and ash in minutes. But this was different. This fire hadn't consumed. It had transformed.\n\nA cry—thin, desperate, trapped—cut through the silence.\n\nHe ran.\n\nAt the end of the south lane, a cottage had folded in on itself like a paper lantern crushed by an invisible fist. \"Hold on!\" Caelin called, dropping to his knees in the debris. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here,\" a small voice gasped, barely audible through the rubble. \"It's hot—please—\"\n\nHe found her beneath a collapsed roof beam: maybe eight years old, freckled face streaked with soot, pinned by timber that still shimmered with residual heat. Her eyes were wide with terror, tracking the glow in the wood above her.\n\n\"You're going to be all right,\" he said, setting his palm against the scorching beam.\n\nHe called the flame the way he always had—shaping heat to eat along the grain, to reduce wood to ash and set her free. But the magic answered differently this time. The beam didn't char or crumble. It softened. Fibers gave way beneath his touch, going glassy and viscous, sloughing under his hand in a slow, honey-thick peel. He drew the beam aside in a translucent sheet; the instant it left contact with his skin, it hardened with a sharp crack and shattered.\n\nThe girl stared up at him with wonder and fear in equal measure.\n\nHe stared at his own hand.\n\n\"Fire shouldn't do this,\" he murmured, more to himself than to her.\n\nHe gathered the child up in his arms, feeling how she trembled against him. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Mira.\"\n\n\"I'm Caelin. Close your eyes now. The air's bad out here.\"\n\nOutside, where the square's wind provided some relief from the smoke, she curled into his travel cloak like it was the only safe thing left in the world. Her lips trembled as she tried to form words.\n\n\"Mama said to hide,\" she whispered finally. \"But the red lady saw me anyway. She spoke to me.\"\n\n\"The dragon?\" Caelin asked, though something in his chest already knew the answer.\n\nMira nodded, her small fingers clutching his cloak tighter. \"She said she was looking for the ember-born. She said she was sorry but she had to know.\" The child's voice dropped to barely audible. \"Then she sang something. A rhyme. Over and over while the fire came. I... I remember it.\"\n\nBefore he could respond, Elder Gareth emerged from the smoke—one cheek blistered raw, his beard singed away on that side, but his eyes still steady with the kind of strength that comes from bearing witness to catastrophe.\n\n\"You saved one,\" the old man rasped, his voice thick with smoke and grief. \"The gods bless you for it.\"\n\n\"She wasn't hunting,\" Mira whispered against Caelin's shoulder. \"She kept saying she was sorry. That she had to find someone.\"\n\nGareth nodded grimly. \"Dragons kill clean when they feed—quick, then gone. This was deliberate. Methodical. She melted the shrine down to its foundation stones but left the granary untouched. Destroyed the inn but spared the healer's cottage.\" His eyes met Caelin's. \"She was testing. Calling out in the old tongue, waiting for something to answer.\"\n\nSomething prickled along Caelin's forearms, a readiness sharpening his awareness. He'd spent years studying fragments of Draconic in dusty libraries, and his dreams had carried sounds and syllables that weren't his own. Now the anticipation felt physical, like standing on the edge of a precipice, waiting for the moment gravity takes hold.\n\nMira tugged at his sleeve with surprising insistence. \"The rhyme. Do you want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Please,\" Caelin said, though the answer was already pressing against his ribs like a held breath.\n\nThe child swallowed hard and recited in a thin, earnest voice:\n\nNine the arts and nine the lights, Nine the souls to set them right; Keep the chain and guard the frame— Wake not the Tenth that has no name.\n\nThe words settled into him like keys finding locks, fitting into spaces he hadn't known were waiting to be filled.\n\nGareth pointed beyond the mill with a hand that trembled slightly. \"Her trail ends past the hedgerow. The ground there is...\" He struggled for words. \"The earth has turned to glass. Black glass, like obsidian. There's a crater, and at the center...\" He shook his head. \"You should see it yourself.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" Caelin said, because any other response felt like turning away from something that had been calling him for years.\n\nHe didn’t look back at Mira. He was afraid if he did he would stay, and staying felt like the wrong kind of cowardice.",

                "text": "Act II: The Binding\n\nCaelin left Mira in the elder's care and followed the path of scorched hedge and melted stone. The destruction formed a clear line—deliberate, purposeful—leading away from the village center toward the fields beyond. \n\nMira’s rhyme clung to him like smoke. Each word seemed to settle behind his ribs, waiting for something that hadn’t yet awoken.\n\nWhere the hedgerow ended, the earth had transformed entirely.\n\nA shallow crater yawned before him, perhaps fifty feet across. Its floor and walls were black glass—pure obsidian that caught the morning light and threw it back in dark rainbows. Crystalline spires jutted up from the rim like the fingers of a buried giant reaching for sky. Steam rose in lazy spirals, carrying the sharp mineral scent of transformed stone.\n\nAt the center lay the dragon.\n\nShe was vast beyond mortal scale, easily the size of Gareth's barn. Her hide had dulled from coal-red to ash-crimson, fissured along her flanks where internal heat still glowed like forge embers struggling against the dark. Each breath came as a failing rasp, wet and rattling. Her wings lay crumpled and torn, one bent at an angle that made Caelin wince. But her eyes—old gold, ancient as mountains—still held purpose.\n\nCaelin slid down the crater's inner slope. The glass sang beneath his boots, a low crystalline hum that resonated in his chest.\n\nThe dragon's eye tracked his descent and fixed on him.\n\nHer voice arrived not as sound but as meaning pressing directly into his mind—old Draconic rendered crystalline and clear, as if a fog he hadn't known was there had suddenly lifted.\n\n\"At last,\" she said, and relief colored the words. \"The bloodline answers.\"\n\nHe went to one knee, instinct deeper than thought. \"Why did you do this? All those people—\"\n\n\"I had no choice.\" came the answer, heavy with genuine regret.  \"I am dying. I felt it three days ago—the rot in my heart, the fire going cold. And I carry something that cannot die with me. Something that must pass to one who can bear it.\" Her eye closed briefly. \"I searched the nearby villages. Called out in the old tongue. Used fire to test who might answer, who might have the gift to work flame differently than others.\"\n\n\"You killed them to test them?\" Horror and anger warred in his chest.\n\n\"I tested the fire,\" she corrected, and there was no defensiveness in it—only weary fact. \"Most would have burned. Only one with dragon-blood could have shaped what I wrought. Only the ember-born could have turned transformation back to wood, glass back to timber.\" Her eye opened and fixed on him again. \"You saved the child. You proved what you are.\"\n\nThe truth of it settled cold in his stomach. She'd been searching for him. And people had died in that search.\n\n\"What are you?\" he asked, voice rough.\n\n\"Vharisax, last guardian of the First Concord. And my time ends.\" She shifted slightly, and the movement cost her. \"But the compact must continue. The Nine must be found. The Seal must remain closed.\"\n\n\"The rhyme,\" Caelin said. \"The child remembered it. Nine the arts—\"\n\n\"Nine that weave the world,\" Vharisax said. Images flooded his mind—dragons and dwarves forging side by side, a name carved above a gate in a script older than any living tongue, nine pedestals blazing with power, and beneath them something vast and chained, pressing against its bonds. The weight of it left Caelin gasping.\n\nCaelin’s breath had gone shallow. He didn’t know when that had happened.\n\n\"The Nine maintain balance,\" Vharisax continued. \"Each school of magic bound into physical form, each requiring a bearer to claim it, to become it. When all nine are claimed and the bearers stand together, the Seal remains closed. But if the Nine are scattered, lost, or broken...\" Her breathing hitched. \"The Tenth stirs. And if it wakes fully, the world drowns in entropy made conscious.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" The question came out smaller than he intended.\n\n\"You carry the old blood. Faint, yes—diluted through generations—but present. You can bond with what I give you. You can survive it.\" Her foreclaw trembled as she lifted it. \"And you have no choice. I am dying now. If I do not pass this on, it dies with me. The compact breaks. The chain weakens.\"\n\nNestled against talon and scale lay a plate of obsidian-red, roughly the length of his thumb, hexagonal edges still carrying forge-heat. It pulsed with inner light—ember-motes drifting in its translucent depths.\n\nNot a shed scale. An offering.\n\n\"This is the key,\" Vharisax said. \"Take it. Bind yourself. Follow the path I will leave you. Find the First Sanctum and claim what waits there—the Dragon's Ember, first of the Nine, forged for Evocation itself.\" Her eye held his. \"And then find the others who must bear the rest. You cannot do this alone.\"\n\nHis hand hovered above the scale, every instinct screaming that this was a threshold he couldn't uncross. \"What will it do to me?\"\n\n\"It will mark you. Visibly. Permanently.\" No false comfort. \"It will guide you toward what must be found. It will punish deception and reward truth. It will hurt, especially at first.\" Her tone softened slightly. \"And it will make you exactly what you already are—only more so. The magic you've always carried will awaken fully. You will understand the old tongue. You will see the paths others cannot.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Then I die carrying this burden. The compact weakens. The Seal cracks a little more. And in a generation, perhaps two, something that should never breathe air will taste sky.\" She held his gaze. \"I do not offer you glory, ember-born. I offer you necessity.\"\n\nThe weight of her certainty pressed against him. The crater, the transformed village, the child's terrified eyes—all of it leading to this moment.\n\nCaelin closed his fingers around the scale.\n\nHeat surged up his arm—hot glass seeking its shape, reality rewriting itself cell by cell. For a moment the world went white, then cleared, he looked down at his right forearm.\n\nA thumb-length, hexagonal plate lay flush with his skin just below the elbow—dark as translucent obsidian, smooth as glass, with ember-motes drifting lazily in its depths like captured stars. The edges were perfect, geometric, inlaid so seamlessly with his flesh that he couldn't tell where the scale ended and his skin began.\n\nFrom its six edges, hair-fine black filaments spread like delicate root systems, threading beneath his skin in branching patterns. They ran toward his elbow, toward his wrist, mapping themselves along nerve pathways with dark precision. He could feel them settling, finding their places, becoming part of his body's geography.\n\nHe flexed his fingers. The embedded plate flexed with him, the filaments shifting beneath his skin like living tattoo.\n\n\"There,\" Vharisax said, and satisfaction colored her fading voice. \"The bond is struck. You are marked. You are chosen.\"\n\n\"It will answer you,\" she continued, each word coming slower. \"And it will correct you. When you speak falsehood, it will sting. When you hesitate before necessity, it will push. When you attempt to flee your purpose...\" A thread of dark humor. \"It will drag you back to the path.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he said.\n\nThe embedded plate snapped white-hot—a needle of searing light that lanced through every nerve in his arm. He gasped, biting back a cry, and the glow subsided to steady ember.\n\n\"Truth,\" Vharisax said, approval warming the word. \"Already you learn. Never lie to the scale, ember-born. It knows you better than you know yourself.\"\n\nHe cradled his arm, feeling the residual heat pulse beneath his skin. \"What do I do now?\"\n\n\"Follow the flame-path I will leave. It leads to the Emberpeaks, to the First Sanctum. There you will find the Dragon's Ember—the first of the Nine Relics, the anchor of Evocation itself. Claim it. Bond with it fully.\" Her breathing grew more labored. \"Then seek the others. The bearers are out there, scattered, most unaware of what they're meant to become. You must find them. Gather them. Before the Seal breaks entirely.\"\n\n\"And the Tenth?\" he asked. \"What's truly buried there?\"\n\n\"Old,\" she whispered. \"A bargain made in the world's first age. Power that should never have been. The Nine were forged to keep it sleeping.\" Her voice dropped to bare thread. \"If you hear it calling—and you will, if you draw too close—do not answer. Do not try to wake it. Not yet. Perhaps not ever.\"\n\nHer chest rose once more, held, and fell for the final time. The glow along her fissured flanks dimmed—and then, instead of darkness, it brightened.\n\nNot the orange of living fire. Something older. Deeper. The light moved through her scales the way flame moves through paper held to a candle—catching at the edges first, the great plates along her spine curling inward as they ignited, translucent and amber before dissolving to nothing. The transformation swept forward from her tail to her throat in a slow, inevitable tide. Scale by scale, ridge by ridge, the body that had carried a thousand years of memory began to come apart—not violently, not with heat or sound, but with the quiet authority of something that had decided it was finished.\n\nCaelin couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away.\n\nVharisax burned like a letter burning—edges first, then the body of the thing, each piece glowing brilliant before it released. Her wings went last, the great membranes thinning to lace, to light, to nothing. Where she had lain, the crater floor held only the ghost of her outline in glass.\n\nAnd then the embers came for him.\n\nThey rose in a slow column—ten thousand motes of ash and amber light, drifting upward as if gravity had briefly lost interest in them. They turned in the air above the crater, unhurried, and Caelin understood with bone-deep certainty that they were not random. They were choosing.\n\nThe column tilted. Descended.\n\nThey settled on the scale.\n\nOne by one, and then in streams, and then all at once—every mote of what had been Vharisax finding its way to the obsidian plate in his forearm, sinking into the translucent surface and becoming part of the ember-motes already drifting there. The scale flared so bright he had to turn his face away. Heat moved through the filaments like a second bonding—not painful this time, but immense. The weight of it. The age of it. A thousand years of flight and memory and purpose flowing into six inches of hexagonal obsidian set in a man’s arm.\n\nWhen the last ember settled, the crater was empty.\n\nThe scale dimmed to its steady coal-glow. The filaments cooled. Caelin stood in the glass-smooth hollow where a dragon had died, and breathed, and tried to understand what he was carrying now.\n\nFrom the crater’s rim, the flame-path stretched away toward distant mountains—fine as a thread of silk, bright as a road paved with light. It hadn’t been there a moment ago. Or perhaps it had always been there, and something in him had finally learned to see it.\n\nFootsteps crunched on glass behind him.",

                "text": "Act III: Unlikely Alliance\n\n\"Well,\" a voice observed, dry as desert wind. \"That looks profoundly uncomfortable.\"\n\nCaelin spun, hand instinctively moving to the sword at his hip.\n\nA woman leaned against the glass ridge, arms crossed, assessing him with the calm focus of a predator deciding if he was a threat or opportunity. Twin daggers rested at her hips, their hilts worn smooth with use. Her travel cloak was torn and stained with ash, and one eye was green while the other shone gold, catching the light like a cat's.\n\nHer expression suggested she found the entire situation darkly amusing.\n\n\"Virella Sunshadow,\" she said, not moving from her perch. \"Though people who haven't tried to murder me yet generally call me Vex.\"\n\n\"How long have you been there?\" Caelin asked, still catching his breath from the bonding.\n\n\"Long enough.\" She pushed off from the stone and slid down the glass slope with practiced ease, boots finding purchase where he would have slipped. \"Long enough to watch a dragon die passing something to a stranger. Long enough to see that very permanent addition to your arm.\" Her mismatched gaze dropped to the embedded scale, studying it with professional interest. \"Interesting accessory. Not exactly subtle.\"\n\nCaelin instinctively tried to cover it with his other hand, then stopped. What was the point? The scale was flush with his skin, inlaid like jewelry he could never remove. \"You shouldn't be here. This is—\"\n\n\"Dangerous? Obviously.\" Vex stopped a few feet away, close enough to talk comfortably, far enough to react if he proved hostile. \"But I've been tracking something dangerous for months now, so the ambiance feels appropriate.\"\n\n\"Tracking what?\"\n\n\"Answers.\" She pulled a water-stained journal from inside her cloak and held it up briefly before tucking it away again. \"My mother was a scholar. Obsessed with old alliances, ancient pacts, something she called 'fire-kept covenants.' She died six months ago in the Emberpeaks, and all I have left are her research notes and more questions than sense.\"\n\nVex gestured at the dragon's crystalline corpse. \"Her last journal entry mentioned rumors of a dragon searching for something. That was three weeks before she disappeared. So when I heard about a dragon burning villages in a very specific pattern—not raiding, not feeding, but searching—I followed the trail.\" Her eyes met his. \"And here I find not treasure, but you. With that.\" A nod at his arm.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm against his skin, but didn't sting. Whatever else Vex might be hiding, she was being honest about her motivations.\n\n\"Your mother was looking for the same thing the dragon gave me,\" Caelin said slowly.\n\n\"Was she?\" Vex's tone sharpened with interest. \"And what exactly did that dying dragon give you, besides permanent body modification?\"\n\nHe hesitated. The scale warmed in warning—truth or pain, choose. \"A burden. A purpose. A path to follow.\"\n\n\"How poetically vague.\" But her eyes tracked to something behind him, and her expression shifted. \"What are you staring at?\"\n\nCaelin glanced back at the flame-thread stretching toward the mountains, then returned his attention to her. \"You can't see it?\"\n\n\"See what?\" Vex followed his gaze, squinting at empty air above the crater's rim. \"All I'm getting is heat shimmer and the worst headache I've had in months. Which, given my lifestyle, is saying something.\"\n\n\"There's a path. Fire, but not fire. Leading into the Emberpeaks.\" He flexed his marked arm, feeling the scale pulse in time with the distant thread. \"The dragon said only those marked could see it.\"\n\n\"Of course she did.\" Vex rubbed her temples. \"Let me guess—this invisible magic road leads straight into the mountains where my mother vanished. Where the last three caravans disappeared without a trace. Where absolutely nothing good has been heard from in half a year.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\" She let her hands drop and fixed him with an evaluating look. \"New arrangement, then. You need someone watching your back while you follow your glowing destiny path. I need someone who can actually see where we're going and potentially lead me to what my mother died seeking.\"\n\n\"We?\" Caelin raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You walk in front,\" Vex said with the practicality of someone who'd survived on the margins, \"drawing every monster's attention with that beacon in your arm. I follow behind, keeping us both alive with my actually useful skills like not getting eaten. Meanwhile, we both get closer to our answers.\"\n\n\"That's your pitch? I'm bait?\"\n\n\"Mutually beneficial bait.\" Her mouth quirked. \"Look, you're going into those mountains whether I come or not—I can see it in your face. That scale's already made the choice for you. And I'm going regardless of whether you want company, because my mother's last camp was somewhere in those peaks and I'm not leaving until I know what happened to her.\"\n\nShe crossed her arms. \"So we can stumble into whatever's waiting separately and probably both die, or we can watch each other's backs and maybe one of us survives long enough to accomplish something. Your choice, ember-boy.\"\n\nThe nickname irritated him, but the logic was sound. And the scale wasn't stinging—she meant what she said.\n\n\"You said your mother called them 'fire-kept covenants,'\" Caelin said. \"Did her notes mention anything about Nine? Or about something sealed?\"\n\nVex's expression sharpened. \"The Ninefold Concord. She had that phrase written everywhere in her later journals—underlined, circled, with question marks. She thought it was some kind of alliance between dragons and... someone else. Dwarves, maybe. From before the kingdoms.\" Her mismatched eyes narrowed. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the dragon spoke of Nine relics. Nine bearers. And something called the Tenth that has to stay sleeping.\" The words felt too big, too important for the smoking crater and morning light. \"Your mother was looking for the same thing I've just been bound to find.\"\n\nFor a long moment, Vex was silent, her expression cycling through several emotions before settling on grim determination. \"Then I'm definitely coming with you. If the thing that killed my mother is connected to whatever's in your arm, I want to be there when we find it.\"\n\n\"It might not have been a thing that killed her,\" Caelin said quietly. \"The mountains are dangerous even without ancient conspiracies.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" Vex's hand drifted to one of her daggers, a habitual gesture that spoke of comfort rather than threat. \"But she was too good to die to something ordinary. Too careful. If something in those peaks took her, I need to know what. And I need to know if it's still there.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed steady and warm. No sting. Truth spoken plainly.\n\n\"We leave as soon as I can gather supplies from what's left of the village,\" Caelin said. \"The path leads east toward the Emberpeaks. The dragon said there's a sanctum there—the First Sanctum, she called it. That's where we're going.\"\n\n\"We.\" Vex's mouth twitched into something almost like a smile. \"Look at that. Partnership established through mutual desperation and probable doom. My favorite kind.\"\n\n\"I should warn you,\" Caelin added, looking down at the scale embedded in his arm, watching the ember-motes drift in its translucent depths. \"This thing has rules. It punishes lies. Forces truth. I'm not entirely in control of what I might say anymore.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Vex said, surprising him. \"Lies get people killed. I'd rather travel with someone who can't lie than someone I have to constantly second-guess.\" She glanced at the dragon's body, her expression softening slightly. \"Besides, after watching what just happened—whatever that was—I think we're past the point where normal rules apply.\"\n\nThey stood in the crater's heart, the morning sun climbing higher, burning away the last of the smoke. The flame-path stretched toward distant peaks, visible only to Caelin's marked sight. The scale pulsed its steady rhythm against his skin.\n\n\"We should go,\" Vex said. \"Whatever was drawn by the dragon's fire might still be nearby. And I'd rather not explain to the villagers why I was watching from the shadows while their savior got magically branded.\"\n\n\"Fair point.\" Caelin took one last look at Vharisax—already transforming into monument, into legend, into the glass-frozen history of this place. \"Thank you,\" he said quietly, not entirely sure if he meant it for the burden or the purpose or simply for answering the question his entire life had been circling.\n\nThe dragon didn't answer. She'd said everything she needed to.\n\nThey climbed the crater's slope together, glass singing its low crystalline note beneath their boots. At the rim, Caelin paused, looking toward Thornwick's smoke and then toward the Emberpeaks' distant blue silhouette.\n\nBehind them, the dragon lay in her crater of transformed earth.\n\nAhead, the flame-path beckoned with patient, inexorable pull.\n\nAnd on his arm, the scale kept its steady count of heartbeats, marking time until destiny could no longer be delayed.",

The transformation was everywhere—glass-smooth walls that had been wood, crystalline puddles where water had boiled and frozen in the same instant, cobblestones fused into organic curves that caught light like gems.\n\nPeople stared as they passed. Not at Vex—she drew glances, certainly, with her mismatched eyes and road-worn bearing—but at Caelin. At his arm.\n\nHe'd rolled up his sleeve without thinking, too hot from the climb out of the crater. Now the embedded scale was visible to anyone who looked: that thumb-length hex of dark obsidian inlaid flush with his skin, the hair-fine filaments threading away from its edges like black veins beneath the surface. The ember-motes drifted lazily in the scale's depths, visible even in daylight.\n\n\"They're afraid,\" Vex murmured beside him.\n\n\"I saved a child,\" Caelin said, but even to his own ears it sounded hollow.\n\n\"You did. And then you went to meet a dragon and came back changed.\" She kept her voice low, conversational. \"People fear what they don't understand. And that—\" a subtle gesture at his arm \"—they definitely don't understand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. No sting. She was right, as usual.\n\nThey found Elder Gareth in the village square, directing a handful of survivors as they loaded a wagon with salvaged supplies. He looked up as they approached, his gaze going immediately to Caelin's exposed forearm.\n\nThe old man's eyes widened, then narrowed with something that might have been recognition.\n\n\"So,\" Gareth said quietly, straightening with effort. \"She marked you.\"\n\n\"You know what this is?\" Caelin asked, surprise and relief mixing in equal measure.\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember stories my grandmother told. Stories her grandmother told her.\" Gareth stepped closer, studying the scale without touching. \"The dragon-marked. The ember-born. The old songs spoke of them—those who carried fire in their blood and could be chosen as bearers for something greater.\" His voice dropped. \"I didn't think I'd live to see it proven true.\"\n\n\"The dragon—Vharisax—she said I have to find something. Nine somethings. Relics, she called them. And gather others who can bear them.\" The words tumbled out faster than intended. \"She said if I don't, something sealed beneath the mountains will wake. Something that shouldn't.\"\n\nGareth was quiet for a long moment, his weathered face unreadable. Then he nodded slowly. \"Then you'll go. You don't have a choice, do you?\"\n\nCaelin looked down at the scale. \"No. I really don't.\"\n\n\"The mark won't let you,\" Gareth said with certainty. \"It'll pull you toward what needs doing. Push you when you hesitate. Drag you if you try to run.\" He met Caelin's eyes. \"My grandmother said the dragon-marked were blessed and cursed in equal measure. The blessing: purpose absolute. The curse: no peace until that purpose is fulfilled.\"\n\n\"That's about right,\" Vex muttered.\n\nGareth turned his attention to her, assessing. \"And you are?\"\n\n\"Someone following him because he's following something I need to find.\" Vex's honesty was almost aggressive. \"My mother died in those mountains looking for whatever he's bound to seek. I'm going to find out why.\"\n\nThe elder nodded as if this made perfect sense. \"Then you'll watch his back while he watches the path. Good. He'll need someone practical.\" He turned back to Caelin. \"When do you leave?\"\n\n\"Today,\" Caelin said, though he hadn't consciously decided. The scale warmed in agreement. \"The path leads to the Emberpeaks. The sooner we follow it, the sooner...\" He trailed off, unsure how to finish.\n\n\"The sooner you can rest,\" Gareth finished for him. \"If you ever can.\" He clasped Caelin's shoulder with surprising strength. \"You saved my granddaughter. That's a debt Thornwick won't forget. If you need supplies, take them. If you need silver, we have a little. If you need a blessing—\" his voice roughened \"—you have mine. Go with purpose. Return with answers.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Caelin managed.\n\n\"Don't try. Do.\" Gareth's grip tightened. \"The dragon chose you for a reason. Trust that, when everything else fails.\"\n\nA small voice called out: \"Caelin!\"\n\nMira broke away from a group of children and ran toward them, her soot-stained dress flapping. She skidded to a stop in front of him, eyes wide and bright.\n\n\"You're leaving,\" she said. Not a question.\n\n\"I have to.\"\n\n\"Because of what the red lady gave you.\" Her gaze dropped to his arm, to the scale embedded there. She reached out one small hand, hesitated, then gently touched the obsidian surface with one fingertip.\n\nThe scale pulsed beneath her touch—a single bright flare of light that made the ember-motes swirl faster. Mira gasped but didn't pull away.\n\n\"It's warm,\" she whispered. \"Like a heartbeat.\"\n\n\"It is, in a way,\" Caelin said, his throat tight.\n\nMira pulled her hand back and looked up at him with an intensity that seemed too old for her age. \"The rhyme. The one the dragon sang. You're going to find what it talks about, aren't you? The Nine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you come back?\"\n\nThe question hit harder than expected. The scale stayed steady—it would let him answer honestly either way. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"The path is long. What I'm looking for is dangerous. But if I can...\" He stopped, tried again. \"I'll try.\"\n\nThe scale stung—sharp and bright. He winced.\n\nMira's eyes widened. \"It hurt you. Why did it hurt you?\"\n\n\"Because I wasn't being truthful enough.\" He knelt so they were eye-level. \"Let me try again. I don't know if I'll come back. What I'm doing might take years. It might take me to places I can't return from. But—\" and this he knew was true, felt it bone-deep \"—if I succeed, if I find what I'm meant to find, then places like Thornwick will be safer. Dragons won't come searching. Villages won't burn. Children won't lose their mothers.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. No sting. Truth accepted.\n\nMira nodded solemnly, then surprised him by wrapping her arms around his neck in a fierce hug. \"Then you have to succeed,\" she whispered against his shoulder. \"You have to.\"\n\n\"I will,\" he said, and hoped it wasn't a lie.\n\nWhen she pulled back, she was crying, but her chin was set with determination. \"I'll remember the rhyme. Every word. And when you come back, I'll say it to you again so you know I kept it safe.\"\n\n\"I'd like that.\"\n\nGareth gently called Mira back, and she went reluctantly, looking over her shoulder until she disappeared into the group of children being loaded onto the wagon.\n\n\"They're evacuating to Millbrook,\" Gareth said. \"The village council there owes us a debt from the grain shortages five years back. We'll rebuild. Someday.\" He looked around at the glass-transformed ruins. \"Or we'll build something new. Either way, we'll survive.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Caelin said. \"If I'd come sooner—\"\n\n\"You came when you could. You saved who you could.\" The elder's voice was firm. \"That's all anyone can ask. The rest is on the dragon, and she's answered for it.\"\n\nVex touched Caelin's arm—the unmarked one. \"We should go. Afternoon's burning, and I'd rather be in the foothills before dark. Less chance of running into whatever might be drawn by the dragon's death.\"\n\nShe was right. The scale pulsed agreement.\n\nCaelin looked around at Thornwick one last time—at the survivors, the transformed buildings, the smoke still rising from deeper ruins. He'd arrived at dawn to find catastrophe. He was leaving at midday carrying a burden he barely understood.\n\nBut the flame-path stretched before him, bright and insistent and impossible to ignore.\n\n\"Take this,\" Gareth said, pressing a small pouch into Caelin's hand. It clinked with coin. \"Not much, but enough to get you through the next few towns. And this—\" He pulled a folded piece of cloth from his pocket, opened it to reveal a simple silver pendant on a leather cord. \"My wife's. She'd want you to have it. For luck.\"\n\n\"I can't—\"\n\n\"You can, and you will.\" Gareth closed Caelin's fingers around it. \"Honor her memory by surviving whatever's ahead.\"\n\nCaelin nodded, unable to speak past the tightness in his throat.\n\nThey gathered what little they needed—dried meat, water skins, a spare cloak for Vex—and walked to the eastern edge of the village where the flame-path led. The thread of fire stretched across the fields toward where the land began its climb into the foothills.\n\nOnly Caelin could see it, but he felt its pull like a physical thing now, stronger with each passing moment. The scale pulsed in rhythm with it, urging him forward.\n\n\"So we just... walk toward the mountains?\" Vex asked. \"Following something only you can see?\"\n\n\"That's the plan.\"\n\n\"Terrible plan.\" But she adjusted her pack and checked her daggers. \"I've followed worse.\"\n\nThey set out together, leaving Thornwick's smoke behind. The flame-path stretched before them like a thread connecting present to uncertain future. Caelin kept his marked arm exposed—there was no point hiding it, and the scale seemed to pulse brighter when covered, as if objecting to concealment.\n\nAs they walked, the embedded scale kept time with his heartbeat, a steady rhythm that was both foreign and intimate. The filaments beneath his skin had settled into their patterns, no longer feeling like invasion but like something that had always been there, waiting.\n\nThe Emberpeaks grew larger on the horizon, their slopes darkening from blue to grey as afternoon light shifted. Somewhere in those mountains waited the First Sanctum. Somewhere ahead lay the Dragon's Ember, first of the Nine Relics.\n\nAnd somewhere beyond that—beyond the paths and purposes and ancient pacts—waited the thing that must never wake.\n\nBut that was future's problem. Present's problem was putting one foot in front of the other, following a path of fire only he could see, trusting a scale embedded in his flesh to guide him true.\n\n\"So,\" Vex said after they'd walked in silence for a while, \"what happens when we actually reach this sanctum? Do you have a plan?\"\n\n\"Find the relic. Don't die. Probably in that order.\"\n\n\"That's not a plan. That's barely even hope.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. No sting. It was the truth.\n\n\"It's what I have,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Then I guess it'll have to be enough.\" Vex squinted toward the mountains. \"Though for the record, I still can't see anything except regular mountains and impending doom.\"\n\n\"The doom's definitely there.\"\n\n\"Fantastic.\" But there was something almost like humor in her voice. \"At least we're doomed together. That's practically a friendship.\"\n\nDespite everything—the weight of the mark, the magnitude of the task, the uncertainty of what lay ahead—Caelin found himself almost smiling.\n\nThe flame-path stretched onward. The scale pulsed steady. The mountains waited.\n\nAnd somewhere in the distance, something ancient stirred in its sleep, feeling the first link of the chain being forged anew.",

                "text": "Act I: Three Days Later\n\nThree days had passed since the dragon's death, and Thornwick still hadn't stopped smoking.\n\nCaelin had spent most of that time in fever dreams, his body fighting the scale’s invasion while his mind spiraled through visions he couldn’t hold. Even asleep, pain was his pulse—the scale burned, a low ember ache that never cooled. The bonding hadn’t been clean; it rewrote him from the inside out. He’d burned so hot that Vex packed him in snow from shaded hollows just to stop him smoking.\n\nBy the third morning, the fever broke.\n\nThe scale settled to its baseline: a thumb-length, hex-edged plate lying flush in his skin, translucent obsidian with ember-motes drifting inside, pulsing steady. The filaments had spread—not just toward wrist and elbow now, but creeping past the joint. Dark threads visible beneath skin that would never look quite normal again.\n\nHe flexed his fingers, testing. The embedded plate flexed with him. The filaments shifted like roots seeking deeper soil.\n\n“You look less on fire today,” Vex said from the doorway of the half-collapsed inn where they’d taken shelter. Her eyes didn’t match—one gold-hazel, one storm-grey—the only inheritance from a mother who’d spent her life studying magic she wasn’t supposed to touch. “Improvement or just denial?”.  She held a clay cup that steamed in the morning chill.\n\n\"A little.\" The truth came easier after three days of the scale punishing every half-lie his fever-addled mind had tried. \"Different now. Less like fire, more like... weight.\"\n\n\"The veins are spreading.\" Not a question. She'd been watching the progression, cataloging it with the same attention she gave potential threats and profitable opportunities.\n\nHe tugged his sleeve down. The cloth caught on the plate's raised edge—a small, stupid reminder he would never hide it for long. \n\nHe’d tested it that morning out of stubbornness—wrapped it, braced it, even tried steel.: linen wrappings had smoldered after an hour, and the leather bracer from the inn's abandoned supplies had conducted heat until it burned his skin, leaving blisters that still throbbed. Metal was worse—the scale had flared white-hot the moment steel touched it, as if offended by the attempt at concealment.\n\n\"Right,\" Vex said, watching the sleeve ride back up. \"Not ominous at all.\"\n\nShe handed him the cup—broth made from dried vegetables and questionable meat, but hot and real. \"Drink. You need to eat actual food today or you'll collapse halfway to wherever that magic compass in your arm wants to drag us.\"\n\nHe sipped. It tasted like survival—not good, but good enough. \"You stayed.\"“You didn’t have to,” he said, surprised how small his voice sounded.\n\n\"Investment protection.\" She settled against the opposite wall, her own cup cradled in scarred hands. \"Spent three days keeping you alive, forcing water down your throat when you tried to bite me, and listening to you speak fluent Draconic in your sleep—which was deeply unsettling, by the way. Would be wasteful to let you die now.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. No sting. Close enough to truth—she had stayed for practical reasons, even if other reasons were growing beneath the surface.\n\n\"The dreams,\" he said. \"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Nothing I could understand. But you said it with authority.\" Her mismatched eyes studied him. \"And that thing—\" a gesture at his arm \"—lit up the whole room every time you started. Like sleeping next to a forge that randomly decided to perform a light show.\"\n\nHe'd noticed. The scale answered emotion as much as magic: hesitation brought the white-hot sting; fever dreams brought the full prismatic display. He was learning to school his thoughts, to keep them surface-level and practical, to not think too deeply about what he'd become.\n\nThe scale warmed slightly. It knew what he was doing.\n\n\"We should go back,\" Caelin said, pushing to his feet. His legs protested but held. \"To the crater. I need to see it with clear eyes.\"\n\n\"Already scouted it twice.\" But Vex stood as well, checking her daggers from habit. \"Nothing's changed. Dragon's still dead and crystallized. Path still leads to the mountains. Village still looks like someone melted it into modern art.\"\n\n\"I need to see it anyway.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Your funeral. Or mine, probably, since I'm following you.\"\n\nThey left the inn as morning light turned the transformed village into something almost beautiful. Glass-smooth walls caught sun and threw rainbows. Crystalline puddles reflected sky in fractured mirrors. Even the destruction had an elegance to it—the way catastrophe sometimes does, when you're far enough away from the dying.\n\nPeople watched them pass. Fewer than before—half the survivors had already left for Millbrook, unable to stay in a place that wore its trauma like decoration. Those who remained were the stubborn or the broken, the ones with nowhere else to go or reasons to stay that outweighed sense.\n\nA woman carrying a child saw Caelin's exposed forearm and made a warding sign.\n\nAn old man simply stared, mouth working soundlessly.\n\n\"They're afraid,\" Vex murmured.\n\n\"I saved a child here.\"\n\n\"You did. Then you went to meet a dragon and came back changed.\" She kept her voice low. \"People fear what they don't understand. That—\" a subtle gesture \"—they definitely don't understand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. She was right, as usual.\n\nThey followed the path of scorched hedge and melted stone toward the crater. The destruction formed a clear line—deliberate, purposeful—leading away from the village center. Morning mist clung to the hollows, making the landscape seem unreal, halfway between memory and present.\n\nWhere the hedgerow ended, the crater waited.\n\nShe was gone. Not crystallised, not preserved—gone entirely. The glass floor held only the ghost of her outline, a perfect dragon-shaped shadow scorched into the obsidian where ten thousand years of history had finally settled and gone dark. The ember-motes in Caelin’s scale drifted a little faster as he slid down the slope. He wondered if they knew.\n\n“What are you looking for?” Vex called from the rim.\n\n“I don’t know.” He crossed to the centre and crouched at the outline’s edge. The glass was warm here—just faintly, the last of it. His marked arm pulsed once in recognition, amber light catching nothing.\n\n“Thank you,” he said quietly, not sure if it was gratitude or accusation. Maybe both.\n\nThe glass didn’t answer.\n\nFootsteps crunched above—not Vex, different rhythm. Caelin turned, hand moving instinctively toward the sword he'd left at the inn.\n\nA figure crested the crater's rim from the north side—short, broad, trailing a small cloud of steam and the unmistakable tick-tick-whirr of clockwork in motion. Even at a distance, the mechanical clicking carried across the glass-smooth bowl with crystal clarity.\n\n\"That's either the world's loudest thief,\" Vex called down, daggers already in hand, \"or a very confused tinker.\"\n\nThe figure resolved as it descended: a dwarf, copper beard braided with gear-charms that glinted in the light, goggles pushed up on a wild-browed forehead revealing keen eyes beneath. A pack that seemed more metal than leather rode his shoulders, bristling with tools and devices and things that hummed. He stopped twenty feet away, tilted his head at Caelin like a bird examining something shiny, and beamed with the particular joy of someone proving themselves right after a long argument.\n\n\"Aha!\" The dwarf's voice carried genuine delight. \"Knew the readings couldn't be wrong. Well, they're usually wrong, but not about this. Never about this.\"\n\nHe unslung a brass contraption from his shoulder—a brass contraption of spinning dials and trembling needles that twisted light in uneasy patterns. He pointed it at Caelin.\n\nThe device screamed.\n\nNot metaphorically—literally shrieked, a high metallic wail that sent birds scattering from the crater's rim and made Caelin's teeth ache.\n\nThe dwarf slapped it. The screaming became sparking. He slapped it again. Silence, except for an ominous ticking that suggested the device was either thinking or plotting revenge.\n\n\"Brilliant,\" he told the device with genuine affection. Then, to them: \"Thornik Bramblebrew. Artificer, engineer, and occasional brewer of exploding ale—though that last bit's more accident than intention. You're the Ember-born, unless my instruments are lying. Which they don't, except when they do, but not about dragon-marks. Never about dragon-marks.\"\n\nThornik's eyes went wide behind his pushed-up goggles. \"By my beard.\" His voice dropped to something like reverence. \"It recognized my kit.\"\n\nHe took a step closer, goggles sliding down over his eyes with a mechanical snick. The lenses whirred, adjusting, magnifying. \"May I? Grandfather wrote about this—well, he wrote in blood, technically, which was dramatic even for him—but if the resonance patterns match what he described, if the harmonic frequencies align, if the—\"\n\nVex shifted between them—not blocking entirely, but making her presence felt. \"Maybe ask before reaching for things embedded in people's arms. Novel concept, I know.\"\n\nThornik held up both hands, device still humming. \"Fair, fair. Wouldn't want to interfere with an active bonding anyway. Could cause sympathetic feedback loops.\" He paused, considering. \"Or explosions. Fifty-fifty odds, really, and explosions are only fun when they're intentional.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Caelin said, instinctively covering the scale with his other hand. It pulsed warmer, as if objecting to being hidden even by his own flesh.\n\n\"What brings an artificer to a burned village?\" Vex asked, still wary, still positioned to strike if needed.\n\n\"Same thing that brought him, I'd wager.\" Thornik's enthusiasm dimmed slightly, replaced by something heavier—old grief wearing new clothes. \"The dreams. My whole clan's been having them for months. Forges waking in the deep places where we sealed them. Constructs stirring in halls we'd forgotten. The old songs starting up again in chambers we'd filled with stone and regret.\"\n\nHe gestured at the dragon's crystalline corpse, at the transformed crater, at the morning light making art of catastrophe. \"Then three nights ago—the exact night she died—every piece of sensing equipment in Deepstone Hold went mad at once. Every dial spinning. Every alarm screaming. Every blessed instrument pointing here, at this spot, saying 'something fundamental just changed.'\"\n\nThornik pulled a water-stained journal from his coat—leather gone soft with age and handling, pages brittle at the edges, stained with substances that might have been blood or oil or tears. \"My grandfather died believing himself a fool for chasing legends. Spent his last gold on an expedition into the Emberpeaks, came back empty-handed and broken-spirited. Wrote in this—in his own blood, mind you, because apparently sanity's optional in our family—about hearing old songs, about seeing the pedestals of the Nine, about...\"\n\nHe trailed off, shook his head, but his hands clutched the journal like it might escape. \"About warnings. Prices paid. Choices that haunt. He died thinking he'd failed. That he'd missed something vital. That he'd doomed us all by not understanding fast enough.\"\n\nThe dwarf's eyes met Caelin's, and the weight there aged him. \"Point is, if he was right about any of it—if even one page of his mad rambling was true—then everything changes. The old alliances weren't myths. The Concord wasn't legend. And whatever's waking now...\" He glanced at the scale in Caelin's arm. \"It's already started.\"\n\nThe scale flared hot for just a moment—not pain, but insistence. Share it. Tell him. The dragon had said to find others, to gather bearers. This dwarf had come seeking the same truth. His grandfather had died chasing it.\n\nCaelin hated that the scale was probably right.\n\n\"The dragon spoke of nine relics,\" he said, the words feeling too large for the smoking crater and morning light. \"Forged in concordance. Nine bearers to claim them. And something beneath stone—something called the Seal—that has to stay sleeping.\"\n\nThornik's face cycled through several emotions in rapid succession: shock, vindication, terror, and finally settling on manic determination. \"The Concord of Nine. Gods and ancestors and all the stone beneath, he was right.\"\n\nHe opened the journal with trembling hands, pages crackling. \"Grandfather wrote about it. The great alliance—dragons and dwarves forging together, nine artifacts to maintain the balance, one for each school of magic. But there were warnings too. About prices. About sacrifices. About—\" his voice dropped \"—about what happens if the balance breaks.\"\n\n\"What happens?\" Vex asked, climbing down into the crater now, curiosity overriding caution.\n\nThornik looked up from the journal, and his expression was bleak. \"He didn't write it. Just left blank pages with one phrase: 'May none live to learn the answer.'\"\n\nSilence stretched between them, broken only by the soft ticking of Thornik's devices and the distant sound of Thornwick's survivors going about the grim business of salvage and departure.\n\nThe scale pulsed steady in Caelin's arm—counting heartbeats, marking time, waiting for whatever came next.",

                "text": "Act II: Divine Fracture\n\nA sound from the crater's rim made them all turn—the clink of metal on stone, deliberate and measured. Not the mechanical clicking of Thornik's devices but something heavier. Purposeful.\n\nA horse stood at the crater's edge, steam rising from its flanks. Its rider dismounted with practiced ease, though Caelin noted the stiffness in her movements—old injuries, poorly healed, the kind that never quite stopped aching.\n\nShe wore armor that had once been white and gold but now looked sun-bleached and road-worn, the kind of patina that came from months in the saddle without proper maintenance. Not from neglect, he realized, but from lack of time—or perhaps lack of caring about appearances when survival took precedence.\n\n\"I'm looking for Elder Gareth,\" she called down, her voice carrying the formal cadence of someone used to announcing themselves in halls of power. Then her gaze landed on Caelin's exposed forearm—the sleeve had ridden up again during his conversation with Thornik—and she stopped mid-sentence.\n\nThe scale reacted immediately.\n\nNot the white-hot sting of lies or the prismatic shimmer of wild magic. This was different—a steady, golden-ember glow that Caelin had never seen before. The light pulsed from the embedded plate like a heartbeat made visible, warm and... welcoming? No, not quite. Recognizing.\n\nThe woman's hand moved to her sword hilt—not in threat but in reflex—and her palm began to glow. Soft silver-gold light flickered across her skin like a candle struggling in wind, uncertain but persistent.\n\n\"What are you?\" she asked, and the question held no accusation, only genuine need to understand.\n\n\"Cursed,\" Caelin said, because it felt more honest than \"chosen.\"\n\n\"Dragon-marked,\" Thornik added helpfully, his device already whirring as it tracked the interaction. \"First verified case in three generations. Possibly longer. My readings indicate a stable harmonic resonance between—\"\n\n\"I wasn't asking you.\" But her grip on the sword relaxed fractionally. The light in her palm didn't fade, but it steadied somewhat, silver and gold still dancing their uneasy dance but no longer quite so frantic.\n\nShe descended into the crater with care, testing each step on the glass slope before committing her weight. Up close, Caelin could see the exhaustion in her face—the kind that went deeper than lack of sleep, that spoke of questions without answers and certainty turned to sand.\n\n\"Serana Valeblade,\" she said, the formality a shield or perhaps just habit. \"Paladin of the Silver Dawn. I came to offer aid to the survivors, but...\" She looked around at the glass-fused crater, the crystalline dragon, the morning light making art of devastation. \"This is beyond healing. This is divine reckoning.\"\n\n\"Just dragon fire,\" Vex said from where she leaned against the crater wall, affecting casual despite the tension in her shoulders. \"Very enthusiastic dragon fire, admittedly, but nothing divine about it.\"\n\n\"You're wrong.\" Serana's voice carried absolute certainty—the kind that came from hearing gods speak. Then that certainty cracked, and something raw showed through. \"At least... I think you're wrong. I used to be sure. Now...\"\n\nShe closed her eyes briefly, and when she opened them, the exhaustion was even clearer. \"Since the dragon’s death my god speaks with two voices—one preaching mercy, one sacrifice. I used to know which was truth. Now I don’t.\"\n\nShe looked at Caelin, at the scale pulsing its steady golden rhythm in time with her flickering light. \"So I came seeking answers. Or at least clarity. Someone who could tell me if my god has fractured or if I have.\" Her jaw set. \"Instead I find... that.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed again—ember and silver-gold, fire and holy radiance, beating in an alternating pattern like a shared heartbeat. One pulse of gold from the scale, one flicker of silver from her palm, back and forth in perfect synchronization.\n\n\"The gods know,\" Thornik breathed, watching the synchronized pulsing with wide eyes. His device had stopped its usual clicking and settled into a low, resonant hum. \"They know what's waking. That's why her guidance splits—divine will fracturing under the weight of impossible choices.\"\n\n\"What choices?\" Serana demanded, her hand dropping from her sword to press against her chest where the Silver Dawn's symbol hung. \"What could possibly justify telling a paladin to both protect and sacrifice? To both shepherd and... and cull?\"\n\n\"The Concord,\" Thornik said quietly, and suddenly all the manic energy had drained from him, leaving only the weight of inherited knowledge. \"Grandfather wrote about it in the margins. The old alliance required... balance. Sometimes protection meant destruction. Sometimes healing meant cutting away the infected flesh before it could spread.\"\n\nHe looked at Serana with something like sympathy. \"Your god isn't fracturing, lady paladin. Your god is preparing you for choices where both commands will be true at once. Where protecting some means sacrificing others. Where keeping the greater balance requires breaking lesser ones.\"\n\n\"That's not—\" Serana started, then stopped. The silver-gold light in her palm flared brighter for a moment, as if in confirmation, and she looked at it with something between betrayal and understanding. \"That's not the Silver Dawn's teaching. We don't trade lives like currency. We don't choose who deserves protection and who doesn't.\"\n\n\"Maybe you didn't have to before,\" Vex said, surprisingly gentle. \"Maybe the choices were always clear enough that mercy and pragmatism pointed the same direction. But if something's changing—if something sealed is waking—maybe the easy choices are over.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warmer in Caelin's arm, but didn't sting. Truth, whether welcome or not.\n\nSerana was quiet for a long moment, staring at her glowing palm, at the scale answering it with golden light, at the dragon's crystalline corpse bearing silent witness to transformation and consequence.\n\n\"What did she tell you?\" Serana asked finally, looking at Caelin. \"The dragon. Before she died. What did she say was coming that could fracture divine guidance itself?\"\n\nCaelin flexed his marked arm, feeling the filaments shift beneath skin, the embedded plate counting heartbeats with patient precision. \"She said nine relics were forged to maintain balance. That nine bearers are needed to claim them. And that something called the Tenth—something sealed beneath stone—has to stay sleeping.\" He met her eyes. \"She said if the Nine fail, if the balance breaks, then what's buried will wake. And it's wrong for the breathing world.\"\n\n\"The Tenth,\" Serana repeated, and her silver-gold light guttered like a candle in wind. \"My prayers this morning... when I asked what I should do, what path I should follow... the answer came in two voices.\" She swallowed hard. \"One said find the Nine, keep the chain. The other said some chains deserve breaking.\"\n\n\"Which voice was louder?\" Thornik asked.\n\n\"Neither. Both. They spoke over each other, equally strong, equally certain.\" She looked lost. \"How do I serve my god when my god speaks with two mouths?\"\n\n\"You choose,\" Vex said bluntly. \"You pick which voice sounds more like the deity you swore to serve, and you follow that one. The other voice—\" she shrugged \"—might not be your god at all. Might be something else trying to sound like it.\"\n\nThe scale flared white-hot against Caelin's skin—sudden, searing. He gasped, cradling his arm.\n\n\"What?\" Vex spun toward him. \"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Not you.\" He gritted his teeth against the pain. \"The scale. It's warning—\"\n\nThe obsidian plate shifted, and for the first time since bonding, black-violet bled through the translucent surface like ink in water. The ember-motes inside swirled faster, agitated, and the pulse went irregular—fast, then slow, then hard.\n\n\"Corruption warning,\" Thornik said, his device suddenly screaming again. He slapped it silent and checked the dials with growing alarm. \"Three signatures. No, four. Strong ones. Closing fast from different vectors.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" Serana's hand went back to her sword, and this time she drew it. Silver-gold light cascaded down the blade like liquid sunrise.\n\n\"If I'm reading this right?\" Thornik's voice had lost all its cheer. \"Whatever was drawn here after the dragon died. Whatever's been hunting these mountains for something it can finally smell.\"\n\nThe scale's black-violet bloom intensified. The irregular pulse hammered against Caelin's nerves—wrong wrong wrong in a rhythm that made his teeth ache.\n\n\"And these readings...\" Thornik tapped his device as if hoping it was malfunctioning. \"These don't match anything living.\"\n\nA scream rose from the direction of the village—sharp, terrified, and cut short with sickening abruptness.\n\nThey ran.\n\nBoots on glass, then dirt, then cobblestone still warm from dragon-fire three days old. The transformed village seemed to resist their passage, crystalline surfaces slick and treacherous, fused walls creating dead ends where paths used to run.\n\nThe scale's black-violet warning pulsed harder with each step, and Caelin felt something he hadn't felt since the bonding: fear not his own. The scale was afraid. Or warning him to be. Or both.\n\nThey burst into the village square and stopped.\n\nA figure stood over the fallen—someone Caelin recognized, vaguely, from three days ago. A trader, maybe, or a traveler who'd come seeking news of the dragon and found catastrophe instead. The body was intact, clothes recognizable, face still human.\n\nBut the eyes were wrong.\n\nBlack from lid to lid. No white, no iris—just obsidian darkness that reflected no light and seemed to drink the morning sun.\n\nAnd the shadow.\n\nGods, the shadow.\n\nIt moved independent of the figure, stretching and bending in directions that had nothing to do with where the light fell. Tendrils of darkness writhed around the figure's feet, tasting the air like serpents, reaching toward the living with obvious hunger.\n\nThornik's device had stopped screaming and started weeping—a low, mournful tone that resonated in Caelin's chest, in his bones, in the scale's frantic black-violet pulse.\n\nThe corrupted figure turned toward them with liquid grace, head tilting at an angle just wrong enough to trigger every instinct that said predator. When it spoke, three voices emerged braided together—the person it had been, something ancient and cold, and underneath both, the sound like stone grinding stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" it said, and smiled with too many teeth. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\nTwo more emerged from between buildings—moving with that same wrong fluidity, shadows writhing like living things, black eyes drinking light.\n\n\"Behind the wagons!\" Elder Gareth's voice bellowed from across the square. \"Get the children behind the wagons!\"\n\nSerana's sword flared brighter, silver-gold light casting hard shadows. \"Positions!\"\n\nThe scale's black-violet bloom filled Caelin's entire forearm, pulsing so hard it hurt. And beneath the warning, beneath the fear, something else:\n\nPurpose.\n\nThe Dragon's Ember stirred in his chest—not called, not yet, but ready. Waiting for the moment when warning became action, when fear became fuel.\n\nThe shadow-thralls took a step forward, moving in perfect synchronization.\n\n\"Three of them,\" Vex said, daggers appearing in her hands like magic tricks. \"Four of us. I've had worse odds.\"\n\n\"Five,\" Serana corrected, stepping forward with her blade held steady despite the fear Caelin could see in her eyes. \"Stay behind me.\"\n\nThornik set his pack down with surprising gentleness, and when he stood again, he held a fat brass cylinder in one hand and had reached back to unhook the twin axes from his shoulders. \"Right then,\" he said, and his voice held something almost like joy beneath the terror. \"Let's see if Grandfather's warnings were complete. Avert your eyes, lovely people.\"\n\nThe shadow-thralls smiled their too-wide smiles and charged.",

                "text": "Act III: Baptism by Fire\n\nThe fight was short and ugly.\n\nSerana hit first—training overriding fear, muscle memory carrying her forward when thought might have frozen her. Her blade traced an arc of silver-gold light that cut through the air like a falling star, and where it met shadow-tether, the darkness screamed.\n\nNot metaphorically. The shadows shrieked with voices that shouldn't exist, writhing away from the divine radiance like living things recoiling from fire. The thrall she'd struck staggered, its movements suddenly uncoordinated, as if strings had been cut.\n\n\"The light severs them!\" Serana called, her voice steady despite the horror. \"Aim for the shadows, not the bodies!\"\n\nThe corrupted figure knitted itself back together wrong—limbs jerking, spine bending in directions spines shouldn't bend—but it was slower now, damaged, the black in its eyes boiling like tar on summer stone.\n\nThornik didn't wait for a second demonstration. He snapped a rune on the brass cylinder's base and hurled it into the gap between two thralls. It clattered across cobblestone with a sound like manic laughter—tick-tick-tick—and detonated.\n\nThe explosion wasn't fire. It was force—a concussive whump that picked up loose debris and flung it outward in a perfect sphere. Shockwave, grit, and a flash bright enough to paint shadows on walls. The thralls flinched back, shadows fragmenting, bodies stumbling.\n\n\"Ha!\" Thornik bellowed, already reaching for his axes. \"That's the good batch! Patent pending! Please don't steal my design!\"\n\nVex didn't waste breath on commentary. She slid in low while the thralls were still reeling from Thornik's blast, moving with the fluid economy of someone who'd learned to fight in alleys where hesitation meant death. Two quick strikes—precise, surgical, merciless.\n\nHamstring on the first. The thrall's leg buckled, dropping it to one knee.\n\nKidney on the second as it turned toward her. The blade found the gap between ribs like it had eyes of its own.\n\n\"Less talking,\" she said, already spinning away from the third thrall's grasping reach. \"More dying. Preferably them, not us.\"\n\nThe third thrall lunged past Serana's guard, moving faster than something that broken should manage, straight for Caelin.\n\nThe scale ignited.\n\nNot with warning this time. With demand. The black-violet corruption bloom inverted instantly—from warning to weapon, fear to fuel. Heat surged up Caelin's arm, into his chest, and the Dragon's Ember answered.\n\nHe raised his right hand—instinct, not thought—and called fire.\n\nDragonfire came.\n\nNot the careful flames he'd shaped to save Mira, but something older. Rawer. A focused cone of heat that turned the air glass-hot and sent the thrall reeling backward, skin blistering, shadow shrieking as it burned.\n\nThe thrall's movements became frantic, uncoordinated. Whatever was puppeting the body didn't understand fire—or perhaps remembered it too well, knew it from before stone and sealing and the long dark beneath mountains.\n\nThen the cost hit.\n\nThe scale flared white-hot—pain branding every nerve—then cycled through prismatic light to an angry red that hammered with his pulse. Vision tunneled, breath coming ragged.\n\nHe'd pushed too hard, used too much, let the Ember have too free a rein.\n\nPain tore up his arm in waves, each pulse worse than the last. His knees started to buckle.\n\nSerana stepped through him—literally shoulder-checked him backward out of the line of engagement—and brought her blade down in a clean arc that finished the staggered thrall. Silver-gold light washed through the thing's center, and it fell in pieces that began dissolving into smoke before they hit ground.\n\nThornik met the last thrall with a roar and axes—no gadgets now, just dwarf-forged steel and ancestral fury. The first axe bit through a corrupted shoulder. The second took it in the side. \"Back to the pit with ye!\"\n\nThe thrall collapsed, shadows fragmenting like shattered glass.\n\nThey stood in the scorched square, panting, as silence fell heavy and absolute. Around them: smoke, crying from somewhere distant, the groan of a damaged wagon axle, the smell of charred flesh and something else—something chemical and wrong, like copper mixed with rot.\n\nCaelin sank to his knees, cradling his marked arm. The scale pulsed its angry red throb, counting the cost of power used too desperately. Each pulse sent fresh agony through the filaments. He'd known there would be pain—the dragon had warned him—but knowing and experiencing were different countries entirely.\n\n\"Breathe,\" Serana said, kneeling beside him but not touching—as if she understood that contact would only make it worse. \"The backlash will fade. Just breathe through it.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" he managed through gritted teeth.\n\n\"I don't. But it's what I'd want someone to tell me.\" Her honesty was almost comforting.\n\nVex was already checking the fallen bodies—quick, professional, making sure the dead stayed dead. \"These were people,\" she said, and something in her voice was harder than usual. \"Probably from the refugee caravans. Maybe from Thornwick itself.\"\n\n\"Not people anymore,\" Thornik said grimly, wiping his axes on a piece of torn cloth. He bent to examine his device, which had finally stopped its mournful weeping. \"Shadow corruption. Seal-touched, if Grandfather's notes are accurate. The thing beneath uses them like... like tools. Puppets with meat.\"\n\nHe looked up, and his expression was bleak. \"And these weren't scouts. My readings show they were lures.\"\n\n\"Lures for what?\" Serana asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer wouldn't be good.\n\n\"For whatever's coming next. To see who answers. To see who can fight.\" Thornik tapped a dial that still spun lazily. \"And we just showed it exactly what we're capable of.\"\n\n\"Meaning more will come,\" Vex finished. She stood, daggers still in hand, scanning the ruined square like she expected attack from every shadow. \"They always do. News travels fast among monsters.\"\n\nElder Gareth emerged from behind a wagon, two children clutched in the crooks of his arms, his face grey with exhaustion and fear. Other survivors followed—perhaps twenty in total, those who hadn't fled yet or couldn't, clinging to each other and what remained of their home.\n\n\"We cannot hold this place,\" Gareth said, and the words seemed to cost him. \"If they followed the dragon's fire, if they're drawn by what you carry—\" his eyes found Caelin's still-glowing scale \"—they'll follow you. And we cannot survive another attack.\"\n\nThe flame-path flared at the edge of Caelin's vision, suddenly visible despite the pain, tugging like a hooked nerve toward the Emberpeaks. Had it always pulled this insistently, or had claiming his attention in front of threats made it more demanding?\n\n\"You want us to leave,\" Caelin said. Not a question.\n\n\"I want you to lead them away.\" Gareth's voice was firm despite the tremor in his hands. \"Draw whatever's hunting you toward the mountains, away from the caravan route to Millbrook. Give us time to evacuate what's left.\"\n\n\"That's—\" Serana started, then stopped. Her silver-gold light flickered uncertainly. \"That's asking them to walk into danger to protect strangers.\"\n\n\"I'm asking them to do what they were going to do anyway.\" Gareth looked at each of them in turn. \"The mark pulls him. The path leads to the mountains. His purpose isn't here—it's forward, toward whatever the dragon bound him to find.\" His gaze settled on Caelin. \"Am I wrong?\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm agreement. No sting. The old man was right—Caelin would follow the flame-path regardless. The only question was whether he'd lead danger toward innocents or away from them.\n\n\"No,\" Caelin admitted, pushing to his feet despite the lingering pain. \"You're not wrong.\"\n\n\"Then go. Today. Now, before more come.\" Gareth shifted the children in his arms, their faces buried against his shoulders. \"We'll head south to Millbrook. You head east to the Emberpeaks. Separate paths mean separate targets.\"\n\n\"He's not wrong,\" Vex said quietly. \"Strategically sound. Cold, but sound.\"\n\nThornik was already shouldering his pack, checking straps and buckles with practiced efficiency. \"Been planning to head that direction anyway. My instruments have been screaming about something in those mountains since this all started. Might as well investigate with company instead of dying alone and unmourned.\"\n\n\"I came seeking answers,\" Serana said slowly, her hand on her sword hilt, her divine light still flickering between commands. \"Perhaps the answers aren't here. Perhaps they're where you're going.\" She looked at Caelin. \"If my god's guidance splits over the Nine, then maybe I need to see the Nine myself to understand which voice to follow.\"\n\n\"So we're doing this,\" Vex said. \"Following the glowing destiny road into certain danger based on a dead dragon's cryptic instructions. Grand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed steady now—the angry red had faded to something closer to its baseline coal-glow, though the filaments still ached. The black-violet corruption warning had dissipated entirely with the thralls' destruction, but Caelin knew it would return. The Seal knew they were coming now. It had tasted their power and found them wanting to test again.\n\n\"We leave within the hour,\" Caelin said, and even he heard how his voice had changed—less question, more command. The scale approved with a pulse of warmth. \"Gather what supplies you can. Travel light but prepare for weather and combat both.\"\n\n\"Listen to him giving orders,\" Vex murmured, but there was something almost fond beneath the sarcasm. \"Three days with a magic tattoo and he thinks he's a commander.\"\n\n\"The mark commands,\" Thornik said, surprisingly serious. \"He's just learning to speak its language.\"\n\nThey dispersed to prepare—Thornik to check his devices, Serana to tend the wounded one last time before departing, Vex to \"acquire\" whatever supplies the village could spare and wouldn't miss.\n\nCaelin stood in the square as survivors began loading wagons, the work of evacuation resuming around him like he was a stone in a stream. He looked at his marked arm, at the scale that had settled back to its steady pulse, at the filaments mapping his skin in dark tracery.\n\nMira appeared at his elbow—silent as a ghost, still clutching his ruined cloak from three days ago. She looked up at him with eyes too old for her age.\n\n\"You're leaving,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to.\"\n\n\"Because of what the dragon gave you.\" Not a question. She reached out and touched the scale with one small fingertip, and it pulsed gentle warmth—the first time since the fight it hadn't caused pain.\n\n\"Will you keep the rhyme safe?\" Caelin asked. \"The one the dragon sang?\"\n\n\"Every word,\" she promised. \"And when you come back, I'll say it for you again so you remember why you left.\"\n\n\"If I come back.\"\n\nThe scale stung. White-hot, sharp, brief.\n\nMira's eyes widened, but she didn't pull her finger away. \"It wants you to tell the truth,\" she said with a child's directness.\n\n\"It does.\"\n\n\"Then tell the truth.\"\n\nHe knelt so they were eye-level. \"I don't know if I'll come back. The path is long and leads to dangerous places. But if I do what I'm meant to do—if I find what I'm meant to find—then places like Thornwick will be safer. Children won't lose their homes. Dragons won't come searching.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. Truth accepted.\n\nMira hugged him with fierce strength, then pulled back and pressed something into his hand—a river stone, worn smooth, with a hole through its center. \"For luck. Papa said stones with holes are lucky because they've been blessed by water long enough to let light through.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, closing his fingers around it. The stone was warm from her pocket, smooth and real and ordinary in the best way.\n\nShe ran back to the wagons before he could say more, and he watched her go—another person he was leaving behind, another reason to succeed written in the set of a child's shoulders.\n\nAn hour later, they assembled at the eastern edge of the village where the flame-path pulled strongest. Five of them now—Caelin, Vex, Thornik, Serana, and their packs of hastily gathered supplies. Behind them, Thornwick smoked and evacuated. Ahead, the Emberpeaks rose blue and distant and patient.\n\nThe flame-path stretched clear and bright in Caelin's sight, unmistakable as a road paved with light only he could see.\n\n\"So we just walk toward the mountains,\" Vex said. \"Following something invisible.\"\n\n\"That's the plan,\" Caelin confirmed.\n\n\"Terrible plan.\" But she adjusted her pack and checked her daggers one more time. \"I've followed worse.\"\n\nSerana touched the symbol at her throat, lips moving in silent prayer. When she opened her eyes, the silver-gold light flickered but held steady. \"Together then. For whatever answers wait ahead.\"\n\n\"For answers,\" Thornik agreed. \"And for Grandfather's vindication, may the old fool rest easier knowing he wasn't mad after all.\"\n\nThey set out together, leaving Thornwick's smoke behind. The flame-path led them across fields where ash still drifted, toward foothills that climbed into mysteries older than kingdoms.\n\nThe scale pulsed its steady rhythm against Caelin's skin—counting breaths, marking steps, pulling him inexorably forward.\n\nBehind them, Elder Gareth watched from the last wagon, one hand raised in blessing or farewell.\n\nAhead, the mountains waited with patient, geological indifference.\n\n“Five people,” Vex said, not quite to anyone. “Following a road only one of us can see.”\n\n“Seven,” Thornik corrected, patting his pack. “Grandfather’s notes count.”\n\nNobody argued. The flame-path led on. They followed.",

                "text": "Act I: The Forest's Pain\n\nBy noon the road had dwindled to a rutted track, then to a pair of deer paths stitched together by stubborn feet. Bracken scraped their knees as they climbed. The mountains shouldered closer with every mile, their slopes darkening from blue to grey as the sun climbed higher. The air grew thinner, sharper, carrying the green smell of pine resin and something metallic underneath—stone dust, maybe, or the tang of old snow melting in hidden clefts.\n\nCaelin walked at the front because the flame-path only he could see demanded it. The thread of fire was thin as wire in the air, tugging toward the Emberpeaks with patient, inexorable pull. The scale pulsed its steady coal-glow against his forearm, warm enough to feel through fabric when his sleeve rode down. \n\nFour of us now, he thought, glancing back at the others spread along the trail. Three people following me toward something I don't understand, trusting a dragon's dying words and a mark I didn't ask for.\n\nThe thought of them following still felt strange. They owed him nothing, yet they kept pace. If the dragon’s words proved false, he’d only have wasted their time—still more guilt than he wanted to carry for strangers.\n\nVex moved like shadow behind him, quiet and watchful, her mismatched eyes scanning the tree line with professional paranoia. She'd been subdued since leaving Thornwick, speaking only when necessary, and Caelin wondered if she was regretting her decision to follow. But she hadn't turned back. Hadn't even suggested it.\n\nThornik came next, his pack clicking and whirring with every step, occasionally stopping to check a device or adjust a strap. He hummed under his breath—old dwarf mining songs, probably, though Caelin didn't recognize the melodies. The sound should have been cheerful. Instead it felt like whistling past graves.\n\nSerana brought up the rear, armored and alert despite the exhaustion that lined her face. Her hand never strayed far from her sword hilt. Occasionally her lips moved in what might have been prayer, but no divine light answered. The silver-gold flicker that had synchronized with his scale during the fight was gone, leaving only silence and the creak of worn leather.\n\nShe caught him looking and offered a small, tight smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Her palm rested for a moment against the Silver Dawn’s symbol at her throat. The light that had answered her sword in Thornwick—that silver-gold radiance she’d wielded like a second blade—stayed dark. She dropped her hand and kept walking.\n\nI’m dragging them into something I don’t understand, he thought, and the scale warmed fractionally but didn’t sting.\n\nThey found the wrongness where the flame-path crossed an older trail beneath a canopy of oaks.\n\nThe trees should have been green. It was summer, full leaf season, when the forest wore its heaviest dress. Instead the oaks looked like they were dying from the inside out—leaves spotted with black and crisping at the edges, bark peeling in long spirals to expose pale wood underneath that looked almost diseased. Roots had heaved out of the soil in grotesque tangles, as if something beneath had tried to crawl free and failed.\n\nThe air here smelled wrong. Sweet rot underneath the pine—like fruit left too long in summer heat, or meat beginning to turn. Caelin's stomach turned with it.\n\n\"Corruption,\" Thornik said, his device suddenly clicking faster. \"Magical blight. The Weave's been damaged here—torn, maybe, or poisoned. Nothing natural about this.\"\n\n\"How recent?\" Vex asked, hand on a dagger hilt as she scanned the dying trees.\n\nThornik adjusted his goggles, peering at readings that meant nothing to Caelin. \"Weeks, maybe. Growing steadily. Whatever caused it is still active, still spreading.\" He glanced at Caelin. \"Probably spreading from the same source that's pulling you forward.\"\n\n\"The sanctum,\" Serana said quietly. \"If the Dragon's Ember is waking, if the First Sanctum is activating after centuries dormant, it would affect the natural world around it. Magic this old doesn't wake gently.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed agreement—steady, warm, confirming what he already feared. They were walking toward the source of the corruption, drawn by the same force that was killing the forest.\n\nMore blood on my hands, Caelin thought. Even the trees can't escape what I'm bringing.\n\nA sound made them all freeze—footsteps, deliberate and unhurried, coming from the trail ahead where it curved through the dying oaks.\n\nA woman stepped out from between the trees and stood in their path.\n\nShe wore a cloak the color of lichen, grey-green and alive, and a circlet of vine that bloomed with each breath. Moss-ink tattoos curled down her arms, pulsing faintly—life answering something older than her heartbeat.\n\nHer eyes were brown, clear, and full of a grief so steady it had settled into patience.\n\nShe looked at them—at Vex's ready daggers, at Thornik's clicking devices, at Serana's armored vigilance—and then her gaze found Caelin. Found the scale in his forearm. And stopped.\n\n\"The forest screams,\" she said, with no preamble and no apology. Her voice carried the kind of calm that came from accepting terrible truths. \"Something tears the Weave at its roots. I feel it dying with every step I take.\"\n\n“Another stray,” she murmured, just loud enough for him to hear. “We keep collecting them. At this rate we’ll need a cart.”\n\n\"We don't mean harm,\" Serana said, stepping forward with palms open in universal peace. \"We're bound for the mountains. If you need aid—\"\n\n\"We're going to the same place,\" the woman interrupted, stepping past the paladin as if drawn by invisible thread. She stopped directly in front of Caelin, studying the scale with an intensity that made him want to step back. Her gaze traced the hex-edged plate, the hair-fine filaments webbing beneath his skin, the ember-motes drifting in translucent depths.\n\nThe embedded plate pulsed before she’d finished speaking—not the white-hot sting of a lie caught, not the black-violet of corruption near. Something quieter. A warmth that started at the hex-plate’s centre and spread outward through the filaments like the first heat of a banked fire finding new fuel. Caelin looked at his arm, surprised. He hadn’t done that. It had.\n\n\"You carry a wound,\" the woman said softly, her hand hovering over the scale without touching, close enough for warmth to pass between them. \"And a key.\"\n\nThornik, already riffling in his pack for a device, froze halfway. \"Oh.\" His voice carried a reverence Caelin hadn't heard from the dwarf before. \"One of the Green. Haven't seen a circle-mark since Grandfather's time.\"\n\n\"The Green?\" Vex's tone suggested she didn't like not knowing things.\n\n\"Druids,\" Thornik said quietly. \"The old kind. The ones who remember what the world was before kingdoms carved it into property lines and tax districts. They're supposed to be extinct—or at least so rare you could spend a lifetime looking and never find one.\"\n\n\"Not extinct,\" the woman said, and something sad colored her voice. \"Just... solitary. The circles broke when the balance did. Most of us walk alone now.\"\n\nShe returned her attention to Caelin's arm, her hand still hovering. The tattoos along her forearms brightened from dull verdant to something closer to true emerald—living light that carried the smell of spring rain and turned earth, clean things, growing things, the opposite of the rot-sweet corruption in the dying forest around them.\n\n\"Names,\" Vex cut in, practical and slightly edged. \"We use them. They keep strangers tidy.\"\n\nThe woman inclined her head, touching two fingers to her sternum then to the nearest dying oak. Under her touch, the bark seemed to ease slightly—the spiral peel settling back into place for a heartbeat before resuming its slow corruption. \"Elowen. Of Sylvaran Grove.\" Her attention returned to the scale. \"Does it burn you?\"\n\n\"Always,\" Caelin said, the truth coming easier after days of the scale punishing evasion.\n\nThe scale snapped a tiny white spark under his skin—irritated sting at the too-simple answer, reminding him it burned worse when he lied or turned from the path, and lately it burned just from existing, just from being what it was: a brand of purpose he couldn't escape.\n\nHe grimaced at the sting.\n\nSomething shifted in Elowen's expression—not pity, but recognition. The look of someone who understood pain that didn't stop. \"May I try to ease it?\"\n\nCaelin hesitated. Another stranger. Another person I'm drawing into whatever waits in those mountains. She should run. They all should. Every step I take toward that sanctum might be leading them to the same fate as those shadow-thralls—corrupted, broken, used as puppets for something that shouldn't breathe.\n\nBut the scale pulsed again, insistent and warm, and he found himself nodding before caution could override the desperate need for relief.\n\n\"Please,\" he said.\n\nElowen lifted her hand, palm hovering an inch above the embedded plate. The tattoos along her arms brightened from dull verdant to true emerald—living light that carried the smell of spring rain and turned earth, loam and new growth and the clean promise of things taking root. She breathed out in a low, rhythmic cadence—older than words, steady as tide against shore.\n\nThe scale cooled.\n\nNot disappeared—it would never disappear, he understood that now with the clarity of permanent things. But the ember-motes drifting inside the obsidian slowed their restless wheel, settling into a gentler tide. The ache that had lived in the filaments since Thornwick—the small, constant hurt he'd learned to ignore because there was no alternative—drew back like a wave retreating from shore.\n\nCaelin's breath caught. He hadn't realized how loud the pain had gotten until it quieted.\n\n\"Light answers light,\" Serana murmured, half-prayer. Her silver-gold divine radiance flickered in response to Elowen's green, two different magics recognizing each other across the space of faith and nature.\n\n\"How—\" Thornik started, his device forgotten in his hands.\n\n\"The mark fights itself,\" Elowen said quietly, her hand still hovering. \"Power and pain tangled together, pulling in different directions. Nature can't heal what was forged—can't undo what dragon-fire branded into flesh—but it can remind the body that rest exists. That pain isn't the only truth.\" Her eyes met Caelin's. \"It won't last long. An hour, maybe two. But it will help.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he managed, the words inadequate for the gift she'd just given—minutes, maybe an hour, without the constant low-grade agony that had become his new baseline. Don't get used to it, he told himself. She won't always be there. Learn to live with the pain, not depend on its absence.\n\nElowen's gaze drifted past him to the flame-path he followed—invisible to her, but she seemed to sense its direction the way animals sense coming storms. \"The pain pulls me the way your fire pulls you,\" she said. \"The forest's agony, the corruption spreading, the Weave tearing—it's all coming from the same wound you're being drawn toward.\" Her expression settled into calm acceptance. \"We follow the same path for different reasons. But we're going to the same place.\"\n\nShe fell into step when they moved on. She didn't ask to join them. Didn't request permission or offer explanation beyond what she'd already said. She simply matched their pace and looked up the trail with the calm of someone who'd been walking toward this for a very long time, knowing it would hurt and going anyway.\n\n\"Tree-hugger,\" Vex muttered under her breath, not quite unkindly. \"Don't get used to her. The forest types always disappear when the fun starts.\"\n\nThe fun, Caelin thought bitterly, feeling the borrowed hour of relief settling into his bones like a temporary reprieve from sentence. Is that what we're calling it?\n\nBut he didn't say it aloud. Just walked, and for the first time since the bonding, his steps didn't quite hurt. The scale pulsed its steady rhythm—softer now, gentler, as if Elowen's magic had convinced it to stop shouting quite so loudly.\n\nThey climbed through the afternoon, and the mountain made them earn every step.\n\nThe trees thinned as altitude stole the soil from under their roots. What remained were twisted pines clinging to rock faces, their needles brown-tipped and dropping, the scent of healthy forest giving way to stone dust and the cold mineral smell of high places where nothing soft survived.\n\nThin air burned his lungs, and the scale’s brief mercy was already fading—the ache creeping back like water through cracks.\n\nThis, he realized, was what the dragon had left him with—pain and questions, a direction without explanation. The others followed because the road existed, not because they believed in him. That was almost worse\n\nThe flame-path brightened as they climbed higher, thin wire hardening to a seam of molten thread that seemed to burn brighter with every switchback. Even Serana cocked her head once and said, \"Do you hear that? Like a hum under the wind.\"\n\n\"I hear it too,\" Thornik confirmed, pulling a tuning fork from his pack. He held it near Caelin's arm and grinned when it thrummed in resonance. \"Harmonic frequency. Gets stronger the closer we get to the source. That's forge-work if I've ever sensed it.\" He tapped his goggles. \"My grandfather would have killed to see readings like this.\"\n\n\"What happens when we reach the source?\" Serana asked, though her tone suggested she wasn't sure she wanted the answer.\n\nThornik's cheer dimmed. \"Depends if it's sleeping or hungry.\"\n\n\"On that note,\" Vex said, already scanning the barren slopes ahead with professional wariness, \"how much does everyone not want to camp on an open ridge under whatever's hunting us?\"\n\nThe sun was dropping toward the western peaks, painting the sky in shades of copper and blood. The temperature was falling with it—fast enough to make their breath visible, fast enough to remind them that mountains killed the unprepared with casual indifference.\n\n\"There,\" Elowen said, pointing to where the trail curved around a shoulder of stone. \"Shelter. Old shelter. Made by those who flew rather than climbed.\"\n\nThey followed her indication and found one of the old drake-cut caves—an arched mouth in the rock, soot-stained from fires gone cold centuries ago. Inside, the ceiling curved in a way no human mason would have chosen, overlapping scales of chisel-work that made Caelin think of ribs and bellies and the inside of a great throat. The air here smelled of old smoke and something sharper—sulfur, maybe, or the ghost of dragon-breath long faded.\n\nDraconic script crooked along one wall in low relief, the lines refusing to sit still unless he looked at them sideways. Meaning teased at the edge of understanding.\n\n\"Please tell me that says 'welcome' and not 'beware all who enter,'\" Thornik muttered, running an appreciative hand along the worked stone.\n\nCaelin squinted until the shapes clicked into sense, the translation rising in his throat like memory. \"'Work done under one sky, so all may breathe,'\" he said softly. \"'Forge heat into law. Keep balance or choke.'\"\n\nThe same message from the crater. The same warning. The same reminder that whatever alliance had forged the Nine, it had been built on necessity, not comfort.\n\n\"Comforting,\" Serana said, though her mouth twitched slightly. \"In its way.\"\n\nThey set a small fire just inside the threshold, using deadfall gathered from the slope below. The smoke carried the sweet-acrid smell of juniper and pine, cutting through the sulfur-stone scent of the cave. Outside, the wind worked itself into a fret along the scree, and night fell fast—the way it does in mountains, swallowing sound and warmth in equal measure.\n\nElowen sat near the entrance where she could see the outline of distant dying trees against the blade of moon. She hummed under her breath now and then—not melody so much as comfort, the kind of sound someone makes when they're holding something broken and trying to keep it still.\n\nWhen Caelin's hand cramped around the cup of thin stew they'd made, when the filaments flared hot with the first real pain since her earlier touch, Elowen shifted closer without comment and let her palm hover near his forearm again.\n\nThe ache eased. Not gone—never gone—but quieter. Manageable.\n\nHe tried to put thanks into a look. She nodded once, understanding without need for words, and returned to her humming.\n\nShe shouldn’t be here, Caelin thought, watching the firelight play across her patient features. None of them should. He wasn’t sure if the mark was leading them somewhere important or just refusing to stop. Either way, they followed, and he let them.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm beneath Elowen's hovering hand, and for a moment—just a moment—the guilt eased along with the pain.",

                "text": "Act II: Shadow at the Fire\n\nVex lay on her side with her back to the wall and one hand under her cheek, the other already resting on a dagger hilt with the casual certainty of someone who'd learned to sleep armed. \"If anyone snores, I smother first and ask forgiveness later,\" she announced to the cave at large.\n\n\"I don't snore,\" Thornik protested, settling his pack as a pillow with careful arrangement of the lumps. \"I strategize audibly. There's a difference.\"\n\n\"Worse,\" Vex said, closing her eyes. \"Murder in slow motion.\"\n\n\"I'll take second watch,\" Serana offered, setting her sword within easy reach and removing only her gauntlets before lying down. She kept her armor on—Caelin noticed she always did, as if expecting attack even in sleep, or perhaps unable to feel safe without the weight of duty pressing on her shoulders.\n\nThornik was already muttering to himself about pressure ratios and gear teeth, his voice dropping to a rhythmic mumble that would have been annoying if it weren't so clearly habitual. The sound of a mind that never quite stopped working, even at rest.\n\nElowen remained near the entrance, humming her not-quite-song, a susurrus that seemed to blend with the wind outside rather than compete with it. Occasionally she would pause, tilt her head as if listening to something only she could hear, then resume the melody.\n\nCaelin banked the small fire and let his head tip back against stone still warm from the day's sun. The embedded plate slipped into its sleep-glow—soft light keeping time with his breath, the ember-motes inside drifting lazy and slow, almost peaceful. For a moment he could almost pretend this was normal. Just travelers sharing a cave, resting before another day's climb.\n\nThen the scale pulsed, reminding him of what he carried, and the illusion shattered.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but his mind wouldn't quiet. Every sound outside became a threat. Every shift in the wind became footsteps. The shadow-thralls had found them in Thornwick—what would stop them from finding the group here, trapped in a cave with only one exit?\n\nI've led them into a trap, he thought. One entrance. Stone walls. If something blocks that opening, we're buried alive.\n\nThe scale warmed fractionally but didn't sting. Not quite a lie—just fear circling truth without quite landing on it.\n\nHe listened to the others settling: Vex's breathing evening out into the careful rhythm of someone who slept light but slept nonetheless; Thornik's muttering finally fading to actual snores (though Vex mercifully didn't follow through on her threat); Serana's quiet prayers whispered to a god who might or might not be listening with a single voice anymore; Elowen's humming like a thread connecting them to the forest dying outside.\n\nThe mountain hummed through his bones—a frequency just below hearing, felt rather than heard. He tried to convince himself it was tectonic shift, natural settling, the ordinary sound of stone being stone.\n\nHe failed.\n\nSleep came in fits.\n\n\n\nWhen he woke, there was a man sitting where no man had been.\n\nLong coat. Dark hair pulled back tight. The posture of someone who’d learned to make himself smaller than he was, to take up less space in a room and be forgotten. He wasn’t looking at anyone.\n\n He was looking at Caelin. More specifically, at the embedded scale.\n\nI’m dreaming, Caelin thought, because that was the only explanation that made sense. The fire’s embers pulsed with his heartbeat. The man’s face held the waxy quality of dream-logic, present but not quite real. I’m still asleep. This is fever. This is the scale showing me something.\n\nThe man’s eyes found the plate and didn’t move—ice-blue, pale enough to catch the firelight like mirrors, empty in a way that suggested either perfect calm or perfect absence.\n\nThe fire guttered; shadows wavered strangely across the stone. For an instant Caelin thought the man’s outline darkened where the light should have softened it, but the effect passed as soon as he blinked.\n\nHeat bloomed under Caelin’s sternum—warning, maybe, or simply recognition of another presence that wasn’t natural.\n\nThe man’s hand rested on his knee. His fingers tapped once. Twice. Three times, deliberate as a countdown. Then curled into a fist so tight the knuckles showed white even in dim light. His jaw worked like he was biting down on words that wanted out.\n\nThe fire popped. Nothing moved.\n\nCaelin’s body refused to obey him, every nerve drawn tight beneath his skin. The scale’s heat intensified—not pain but urgent awareness, the same frequency it had hit during the shadow-thrall attack in Thornwick.\n\nA breath caught somewhere to Caelin’s left. Vex had woken without stirring, without even changing the rhythm of her breathing. He felt her awareness like a second set of eyes in the dark. Her dagger hand hadn’t shifted position, but he knew it was ready. Elowen’s humming had stopped; the silence pressed against the cave walls like held breath.\n\nThe stranger’s fingers relaxed again, the motion careful, as if wrestling with a thought he chose not to follow. The air seemed to ease with him.\n\nTime stretched like hot glass between one ember-pop and the next. The man didn’t blink. Then—without transition, without sound, without any sense of departure—he simply wasn’t there anymore. Not stood and walked away. Not faded like mist. Just … gone.\n\nCaelin didn’t know when he slept again. Only that when he startled awake to Serana’s gentle touch for third watch, there was no man by the fire. Just embers dying to ash and his companions sleeping and the cave mouth showing the colorless pre-dawn that comes before the world decides what color it wants to be.\n\nHe sat up, heart hammering hard enough to hurt. The plate jogged with his pulse, light keeping frantic pace. The cave mouth was a slice of grey, and the fire had burned to nothing but warm ash.\n\n“Before you ask,” Vex said without opening her eyes, her voice cutting through the silence like a knife, “yes, I saw him. No, he didn’t make a sound approaching or leaving. Yes, I had a dagger ready the entire time. No, I didn’t throw it because he didn’t move and I wanted to see what he’d do.”  A pause. “You’re welcome.”\n\n“Tracks?” Thornik asked, already halfway to his knees, goggles sliding down over his eyes with a mechanical click.\n\n“None that I can find,” Serana said quietly, brushing the cave floor with a pine branch. “But there’s a mark in the ash where someone sat.” She pointed at a neat oval pressed too deep into the dust. “Boot prints from the entrance to that spot—then nothing. As if he arrived, sat, and simply … stopped.”\n\n“Or the light played tricks,” Vex murmured, finally opening her eyes to fix Caelin with a look that hovered between challenge and curiosity.\n\n“The mountain stopped breathing,” Elowen said, stepping in from the pale dawn with frost in her hair. “Just before sunrise everything went still—the wind, the animals, even the corruption’s spread. Then, slowly, it started again.”\n\n“You felt it too,” Thornik said, not a question. His device clicked softly as he measured the prints. “All five of us aware something happened, none of us certain what.”\n\nCaelin’s hands shook as he accepted the water skin Thornik offered. The scale throbbed dull red now—post-danger ache or punishment for his paralysis, he couldn’t tell.\n\nReal, he thought, mouth dry despite the water. It was real. But what was it? A vision? A warning?\n\nThe thought settled heavy in his gut.\n\n“We need rules,” Serana said, voice firm despite the uncertainty in her eyes. “No one sleeps unwatched. Someone always on guard, always armed. If anything — anything — appears that shouldn’t be there, we wake everyone. Immediately.”\n\n“Agreed,” Vex said, sitting up to check her daggers. “And we need to talk about what we’ll do if he comes back.”\n\n“If he comes back,” Thornik corrected, though his tone suggested the same doubt they all felt. “My instruments didn’t register him. Couldn’t. That shouldn’t be possible.”\n\n“Or it was something between real and not-real,” Elowen said quietly. “Like the corruption’s echo. A reflection finding shape.”\n\nThe scale pulsed once, uneasy but quiet.\n\nThey were finishing a cold breakfast of dried meat and hard cheese—no fire, by unspoken agreement—when the man who might have been a dream walked out of the morning mist and into the cave without asking permission.\n\nHe didn’t posture or bow. He simply crossed the threshold as if invited, took three precise steps, and stopped in the same place he’d occupied by the fire—if he’d been there at all.\n\nMorning light showed hollow cheeks, dark hair pulled back tight, ice-blue eyes that held the emptiness of someone who’d made peace with terrible things—or had them carved out of him.\n\nHe glanced at the sword near Serana’s hand, the axes by Thornik’s knee, Vex’s ready dagger, the careful distance they all kept from the cave’s center. Then he looked at Caelin and said, in a voice like the end of a long argument:\n\n“Durgan.”\n\n“That a name?” Vex asked, blade steady. “Or a noise you make before killing someone?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. He also didn’t smile. His face held the blank neutrality of someone who’d learned that expressions invited questions. In the morning light, his outline looked perfectly ordinary.\n\n“What do you want?” Serana asked, her voice not unkind but not lowering her guard either.\n\nDurgan’s gaze slid past her to the scale in Caelin’s arm again, and for a heartbeat something flickered there — a thought with an edge — acknowledged and set aside with visible effort. His jaw worked. “To follow the path.”\n\n“You can see it?” Thornik asked, suspicious now, goggles whirring as they adjusted focus.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then how do you know where to go?” Vex’s dagger turned slightly, catching light.\n\n“I’m pulled,” he said, voice flat. “Same as you.” He nodded once toward Caelin, once toward Elowen. “Different hooks. Same rope.”\n\nLiar, Caelin thought, but the scale stayed quiet. Either the man was telling truth, or it couldn’t read whatever darkness lingered around him. Neither option comforted.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Vex said, stepping between them. “He sat in our camp in the middle of the night and vanished, and you want to — what? — let him join us?”\n\n“We don’t know he’s dangerous,” Serana said, though her hand stayed near her sword.\n\n“We don’t know he’s not,” Vex countered. “And I’m not keen on finding out the hard way.”\n\n“If I wanted to hurt you,” Durgan said quietly, “I would have done it last night.”\n\nThe admission hung like smoke. Confirmation that he’d been there. That whatever had happened had touched all of them.\n\n“Not reassuring,” Thornik muttered. “At all.”\n\n“Rules,” Serana said, authority hardening her tone. “If you travel with us, you follow rules. Watch rotation — someone always awake beside you. You don’t approach anyone while they sleep. Understood?”\n\n“No promises on sleep,” Durgan said, voice almost dry. “But I can try.”\n\n“Not good enough,” Caelin said, finding his voice at last. The scale warmed in agreement. “You show up in our camp without sound and expect us to trust you at our backs?”\n\nDurgan met his eyes, calm and unreadable. “No. I expect you to watch me. Keep weapons ready. Assume the worst. But I’m coming either way.” His voice dropped. “The pull’s stronger than I am. Stronger than what’s left of my choice. I can follow you, or walk ahead. Your call.”\n\nThe blunt honesty of it cut through Caelin’s objections. He isn’t asking permission; he’s warning us. At least if he’s with us, we can see him.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm—not approval, but acknowledgment of logic. Sometimes the safest bad choice was the one you could watch.\n\n“Walk with us,” Caelin said at last. “Back of the line. Paired watches—you’re never alone with anyone. Keep your distance unless spoken to. You cross a line, we stop you. Understood?”\n\n“Clear,” Durgan said, and something that might have been relief softened his features. “Thank you.”\n\n“For what?” Vex demanded.\n\n“For treating me honestly.”\n\n“Well,” Thornik said into the silence. “Splendid. Exactly what I hoped for when I left the safety of Deepstone Hold to chase my grandfather’s ghost notes into cursed mountains.”\n\nDespite his words, he shouldered his pack. Despite her glare, Vex didn’t argue further. Because Durgan was right: he was coming whether they wanted him or not. And if the tension in his jaw meant he was fighting something — fatigue, fate, or his own thoughts — then maybe keeping him visible was wiser than wondering where he’d gone.\n\nAt least this way, Caelin thought, they’d see it coming if he broke.The scale warmed once, unreadable as ever.",

                "text": "Act III: Descent into Shadow\n\nThey filed out a little after sunrise, six now instead of five, and Caelin felt the weight of it like physical mass—six lives following the flame-path he alone could see, trusting a dying dragon's prophecy and a mark he'd never wanted. The guilt pressed heavier with each additional soul.\n\nWhen this goes wrong, he thought, watching Durgan take position at the rear without being asked, moving with the careful precision of someone who knew exactly how dangerous he was, —how do I live with that?\n\nThe scale gave no answer. It only pulled, patient and inexorable as tide.\n\nThe mountain had shifted colors while they'd slept. What had been blue-grey slate was now rust-red iron oxide and black basalt, the stone itself changing composition as they climbed higher. The sky looked closer here, pressing down, and the air smelled of ozone—not quite lightning but something similar, the electric taste of power gathering.\n\nThe flame-path tugged harder now, a steady pull on Caelin's nerves that was almost physical. The scale brightened in response, the ember-motes gathering like small birds startled into flight. His sleeve had given up any pretense of covering it—the fabric scorched if held against the plate too long, and he'd stopped trying. Let them see it. Let the world know what he carried.\n\nElowen walked just left of him, her eyes on the distant dying tree line, one hand occasionally hovering near his forearm when the filaments flared hot. Each time she did, the pain eased—not gone, never gone, but quieter. Manageable. She never asked permission. Never made it seem like charity. Just offered relief the way you might offer water to someone thirsty, simple and necessary and temporary.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said once more, low, not trusting himself with more words.\n\nShe dipped her head, understanding without need for words. No platitudes. No false comfort. Just acknowledgment that sometimes small mercies were all the world offered, and you took them when you could.\n\nHe watched the tiny flowers on her circlet open and close with her breath. For a moment, the sight eased the ache in his arm and the noise in his head. She made the world seem survivable again.\n\nThe path narrowed as they climbed, forcing them into single file along a ridge with air on both sides. Caelin led, followed by Vex—close enough to whisper warnings but far enough to react if he stumbled. Then Elowen, moving with the sure-footedness of someone who'd spent a lifetime in wild places. Thornik came next, his pack clicking and whirring with each step, devices registering readings that made him mutter under his breath. Serana held the center-rear position, armored and watchful. And Durgan brought up the back, moving in silence so complete it was almost worse than sound.\n\nCaelin kept glancing back more often than sense demanded, making sure Durgan was still with them. The man’s ice-blue eyes tracked the scale sometimes, studying it in a way that made Caelin’s skin tighten—focused, analytical, unreadable.\n\nThe light behind them shifted on the trail; for an instant Durgan’s outline looked heavier, darker against the stone, then the clouds moved and it was gone. Probably the sun, Caelin told himself, but he still looked again.\n\n\"Stop watching him,\" Vex murmured from behind. \"You'll make yourself paranoid.\"\n\n\"I'm already paranoid.\"\n\n\"Then you'll make yourself more paranoid, which helps no one.\" But her hand never strayed far from her daggers. She was watching too, just more subtly.\n\nThey made the ridge by late afternoon. The wind here smelled of snow and distance, carrying scents from far below—woodsmoke from some distant settlement, the green-rot of dying forests, and underneath it all, a trace of sulfur that made Caelin think of the dragon's crater. Of transformation and ending and beginnings written in glass.\n\nBelow them, carved into the mountain's face, the entrance to something larger than a lair opened its throat.\n\nThe First Sanctum yawned dark and patient, a hundred-foot arch carved by claw and magic alike—dragon architecture built to outlast empires.\n\nDraconic script traced the cliff face in long strokes—fifty feet high, each character big enough to hold a man. The words shimmered slightly, catching light that wasn't quite there, and even from this distance Caelin felt meaning pressing against his mind like a hand against glass.\n\nHe squinted, and the translation rose unbidden:\n\n\"Work done under one sky,\" he murmured, reading the largest characters, \"so all may breathe.\"\n\n\"And choke if we don't,\" Thornik added quietly, shading his eyes with one square hand as he studied the entrance. \"Balance maintained or all falls. That's the bargain, written plain as day in letters tall as towers. Can't say we weren't warned.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed harder in Caelin's arm—recognition, anticipation, something that might have been eagerness or dread or both. The flame-path led straight through that massive opening, disappearing into darkness that seemed to drink the afternoon light.\n\n\"Well then,\" Thornik said after a long silence. \"Shall we try not to die?\"\n\n\"That's always been Plan A,\" Vex said, though her voice held less confidence than her words.\n\nSerana looked at each of them in turn—evaluating, measuring, finding whatever she needed to see. Caelin watched her gaze linger on Durgan, assessment clear in her eyes, before returning to the group as a whole. \"We go together,\" she said. \"And we come out the same way.\"\n\nCaelin hoped she was right, the scale under his skin stayed silent.\n\nDurgan said nothing. His stance was rigid, shoulders drawn, jaw tight. His hands flexed and stilled as if working through pain or focus.\n\nHow long can he keep that control? Caelin wondered. How long before the pull driving all of them becomes something none of them can ignore?\n\nThe flame-path brightened as they began their descent toward the sanctum, as if eager to lead them inside. The scale's pulse quickened, ember-motes swirling faster, and Caelin felt heat building in his chest—not pain yet, but readiness. The Dragon's Ember stirring, preparing for what waited ahead.\n\nThe path down was treacherous—loose scree and switchbacks carved into stone that had been weathered by centuries of storms. Twice, rocks gave way under Thornik's weight, sending him sliding until Serana caught his pack. Once, Vex's foot slipped on ice-slick stone, and only Elowen's quick grab of her cloak kept her from pitching over the edge.\n\nThey helped each other. Warned each other of loose stones and hidden ice. Moved as a unit despite their differences, despite their doubts, despite the fact that half of them had met less than a day ago.\n\nThis is what she meant, Caelin realized, thinking of Vharisax's words about finding others who must bear the Nine. Not just people with power. People who'll catch each other when the mountain tries to kill them. People who'll watch each other's backs even when they're not sure they should trust what's at their own.\n\nThe thought should have been comforting. Instead it made the guilt worse.\n\nThey reached the valley floor as the sun touched the western peaks, painting everything in shades of copper and blood. The sanctum entrance loomed above them now—close enough to see the details in the carving, the precision in every chisel mark, the way the stone had been shaped not just cut but convinced to take this form.\n\nMore Draconic script covered the archway itself, smaller but no less meaningful. Caelin read without thinking:\n\n\"Below: the heart of fire. Above: the watching stars. Between: those who dared forge law from chaos.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Vex muttered. \"Really sells the 'you probably won't die horribly' angle.\"\n\nThornik's devices had gone from clicking to a steady, resonant hum that Caelin felt in his bones. \"The readings here are... extraordinary. Residual magic so dense it's practically solid. This place hasn't been dormant—it's been waiting. And something recently told it to stop waiting.\"\n\n\"The dragon's death,\" Serana said. \"When she passed the scale to Caelin, when the bonding completed—it must have activated something. Sent a signal to sanctums like this across the realm.\"\n\n\"Meaning they're all waking,\" Elowen said quietly, her hand on a patch of moss growing near the entrance—one of the few living things this high up. She closed her eyes, communing with it in ways Caelin didn't understand. \"The forest feels it. The corruption spreading isn't random—it's directed. Purposeful. The sanctums wake, and with them, whatever was sealed beneath.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed black-violet—brief but unmistakable. Corruption warning. Not immediate, but close. Growing.\n\n\"There's something inside,\" Caelin said, the certainty settling cold in his stomach. \"Waiting for us. The shadow-thralls in Thornwick—they were scouts. Lures. Whatever sent them knows we're coming.\"\n\n\"Then we'd best not disappoint it,\" Thornik said, though his cheer sounded forced. He unslung his axes, checking edges that were already sharp. \"Been wanting to test these against proper ancient evil. Academic curiosity and all that.\"\n\n\"You're insane,\" Vex said.\n\n\"Runs in the family.\" But Thornik's hands were steady on his weapons.\n\nSerana drew her sword, silver-gold light running down the blade. “We stay together. No one goes ahead. No one falls behind. If we encounter hostiles, we fight as a unit.” Her gaze landed on Durgan. “If anything feels wrong—if you lose control—we stop you. Clear?”\n\n“Clear,” Durgan said, drawing a long knife scarred from use, the hilt stained dark with age. “If I lose myself, do what you have to.”\n\nThe calm acceptance in his tone made Caelin uneasy.\n\nThey stood at the threshold together, six people bound by oath and necessity and the terrible gravity of prophecy. The sanctum's darkness waited, patient as stone, deep as time. The flame-path led through it, bright and insistent and impossible to ignore.\n\nSomewhere inside, a sound lifted—so low Caelin felt it in his ribs rather than heard it with his ears. Not a voice, not yet. Just a pulse. Waiting.\n\nA heartbeat. Stone grinding stone. The rhythm of something vast and patient, stirring in depths no light had touched in centuries.\n\n\"This is it,\" Caelin said quietly, as much to himself as to the others. \"Whatever the dragon sent me to find. Whatever's been pulling me since Thornwick. It's down there.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed in agreement, ember-motes gathering, light intensifying.\n\n\"Then let's find it,\" Vex said. \"Before my common sense catches up with my curiosity.\"\n\nElowen's hand hovered near Caelin's arm one more time, and the pain eased—last mercy before descent, last moment of relief before they stepped into darkness that might not spit them back out.\n\n\"May the Green guide your steps,\" she said softly. \"May roots find purchase even in stone.\"\n\n\"May the Silver Dawn light our path,\" Serana added, her prayer formal but sincere. \"And hold back the shadows that hunger.\"\n\n\"May the forges remember,\" Thornik said, touching his beard with one hand in what might have been ancestral blessing. \"And may we be worthy of the heat.\"\n\nVex just checked her daggers and said nothing, but the gesture was prayer enough.\n\nDurgan stood at the back, silent, outlined against the shifting light. For a moment the shadows around him wavered with the torch-flame, and Caelin looked away first.\n\nCaelin took the first step into darkness.\n\nThe scale flared bright—prismatic light painting the walls, revealing carved reliefs of dragons and dwarves working side by side, of nine pedestals arranged in sacred geometry, of power shaped into form and form sealed into purpose.\n\nThe flame-path stretched ahead, bright as daylight in the dark, leading down.\n\nThey followed.\n\nThe sanctum swallowed them whole—six people descending into depths where the world's first bargains had been struck, where balance had been forged from chaos, where something sealed beneath stone had been patiently waiting to wake.\n\nThe mountain’s pulse grew louder with every step, stone remembering how to breathe.\n\nBehind them, the entrance shrank to a point of daylight, then vanished around a curve.\n\nAhead, only darkness and the flame-path and the grinding pulse of stone remembering how to breathe.",

The air thinned and sharpened; the wind came clean off snow. Packs shifted on shoulders.\n\n\"Distribution,\" Thornik announced, already elbow-deep in everyone's straps. \"We die evenly, or not at all.\" He shifted rope to Serana, water to Caelin, tools to himself. \"Climbers carry line, churners carry weight, thinkers carry hope.\"\n\n\"Which am I?\" Vex asked, palming a wire coil into her cloak.\n\n\"An outlier,\" he said cheerfully. \"And therefore essential.\"\n\nSerana took her share without complaint, leather creaking as she settled buckles. Durgan shouldered nothing obvious and still moved like a man who'd learned the weight of steel the hard way.\n\nVex's eyes tracked the motion, a cat gauging another predator. \"You sure he's pulling his weight?\"\n\n\"Leave him be,\" Serana said, not looking back. \"We'll see what he carries when it matters.\"\n\nCaelin bent to swing his pack and a nerve of fire pulled taut from his palm to his shoulder. The filaments under his skin went rigid; heat bled into the muscle. His breath caught, jaw tightening against the gasp trying to escape.\n\n\"Here,\" Elowen said, already there, fingers gentle on shoulder strap and sternal buckle. She re-threaded, anchored weight away from the right forearm, breathed once, close enough that the scent of crushed pine needles rode the cold.\n\nCaelin flinched—just a fraction, instinctive—before forcing himself still. The ache loosened by a fraction.\n\n\"Rest isn't surrender,\" she added, barely above wind.\n\nHe nodded, embarrassed by the relief, embarrassed by the flinch, embarrassed by needing help at all.\n\nBelow them, the valley lay shrunken and ghost-pale, a scatter of glass bones where Thornwick had burned. Clouds pressed low, turning the horizon into slate. For a moment, Caelin almost wished the climb could end there—suspended between ruin and whatever waited above.\n\nThey took the slope in diagonals. By midmorning the sun was a thin coin, bright but without warmth. The mountain's breath came steady and cold, smelling of old iron and thawed bone.\n\nOn the third switchback the trail slipped into scree that hissed downhill. Thornik yelped; Serana hauled him back by the collar. Caelin dropped to a knee as the hum he'd felt since Thornwick climbed a note; for two breaths the slab under them held—roots of a scrub pine clenched stone as if remembering how—then let go gently, enough to recover footing.\n\nBehind him, Durgan hadn’t stumbled at all. He stood motionless on the sliding scree, balanced with the ease of someone who knew exactly how much weight to trust each stone with. His shadow pooled at his feet and then—just for a moment, just at the edge of Caelin’s vision—stretched a half-step sideways from where the light said it should be. Then the stone shifted again and the moment passed, and Durgan was simply a man standing on a mountain.\n\nCaelin's plate tightened—faster pulses, not brighter light—and when it eased the ache came back deeper, settling into bone.\n\n\"Key of D,\" Thornik said, as if the near-fall were a footnote. He held a tuning fork near Caelin's arm; it thrummed. \"Closer to E-flat by the teeth. Oh hello, modulation.\"\n\nVex rolled her eyes. \"If the mountain starts singing harmony, I'm going home.\"\n\nNo one believed her.\n\nSerana lingered a moment longer, gaze drifting down the slope where their footprints already blurred in loose grit. \"The higher we climb, the more the air forgets we belong to it,\" she murmured. It wasn't addressed to anyone. \"If the gods meant us for this, they'd have given us thicker lungs.\"\n\nThornik chuckled, misreading her tone. \"That's why we have rope. Rope's a kind of faith.\"\n\nSerana gave him a thin smile that didn't reach her eyes. \"Faith frays.\" Then she turned and started climbing again.\n\nThe flame-path in Caelin's vision had gone from fine hair to taut filament, tugging north and up like a hand on a hook. The others heard it as a hum under wind—the way a kettle sings before it boils.\n\nHe stopped trying to drag his sleeve down. The last linen had singed his skin where it crossed the inlay. The mark would be seen or it would burn him for the privilege of pretending.\n\nDurgan moved behind him, silent as falling ash. \"The pull's stronger,\" he said. Caelin glanced back. Durgan's eyes stayed on the ridge ahead, unreadable.\n\nIt wasn't shame that made him hide it now, just the wish to look ordinary for one more heartbeat before the next mountain took it away.\n\nThey climbed, and the hum followed—steady, rising, like breath drawn before a word. The flame-path kinked sharply ahead at the ridge, insisting on a particular route. Caelin squinted through thin air and made out where the path narrowed between two wind-carved pillars. Something was already there. He could see the outline of it—someone standing where there had been no one a moment before.",

                "text": "ACT II: NYXARA AT THE CHOKE POINT\n\nThe ledge narrowed between two wind-carved pillars.\n\nShe was already there, leaning where the light fell best, as if the mountain had practiced with her beforehand.\n\nNight-silk hair. Violets for eyes, not color so much as focus: not where you were, but where you looked from. Her clothes were court-sin applied to travel: layered, impractical, and somehow no worse for the walk. She carried almost nothing and yet the air around her moved on a slightly different beat, like a ripple behind the rhythm.\n\n\"I've been tracking something hot all morning,\" she said, and let her gaze travel—very deliberately—from the obsidian plate pulsing in Caelin's forearm to his mouth.\n\nThornik fumbled his striker. tink—tink—tink. \"That's a pressure fuse—\" he squeaked, and dove to catch it.\n\nVex slid her eyes past Caelin. \"Let me guess—another follower of the... whatever we're following.\"\n\n\"Something like that, darling,\" the woman purred.\n\n\"Don't call me darling,\" Vex said, already bored.\n\n\"Call me Nyx—everyone does when they want something,\" the woman said, smiling. \"Or Nyxara if you're feeling ceremonious.\"\n\n\"I'll stick with Nix,\" Vex said. \"Short for no.\"\n\n\"Mmm. Most men beg to make it yes by the end.\"\n\n\"Lucky I'm not most men.\"\n\nSerana's scowl could have salted meat. Her hand drifted to her hilt by reflex. Elowen passed without pausing, humming the tune she used to keep herself steady. Durgan didn't look at Nyxara at all; he looked past her—as if measuring the ledge for exits.\n\nThe plate in Caelin's arm lifted a faint silver shimmer—magic near magic, attention not threat. No black-violet bloom. Just the world noticing.\n\nThornik’s device clicked twice—the particular pattern it made when registering magic it hadn’t catalogued before. “Warlock,” he said quietly, more to himself than anyone. “Bound talent. She’s drawing from something old. Something that made a bargain before she was born.”\n\n\"Patrons grow restless when old covenants stir,\" Nyxara said lightly. \"Nine arts, nine lights—such pretty math. I follow the sums.\"\n\n\"We're not hiring,\" Vex told her.\n\n\"Good,\" Nyxara said. \"I'm terribly expensive.\"\n\nThornik had his striker back in its pouch. \"Do patrons always rehearse entrances, or is that just—\" He stopped himself before saying something he'd regret. \"Nyxara,\" he corrected briskly.\n\nNyxara's smile didn't change, but the air cooled by a degree.\n\n\"Entrances are for the audience.\" She nodded at the arch. \"The mountain has excellent taste.\"\n\nCaelin weighed the two options: a knife at their backs or one where he could see the blade. The scale kept a tightened pulse—not warning, not ease.\n\nHe thought about Durgan's words from days ago: I can walk with you, or I can follow you. If I follow, you won't know where I am when you sleep.\n\nThe logic was the same here.\n\n\"Walk with us,\" he said, keeping his voice neutral. \"It's a long way to fall alone.\"\n\nThe threat was there, unspoken but clear. Nyxara heard it and her smile widened—not offended, amused.\n\n\"Safer for everyone,\" he added.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Vex murmured. \"A complication with cheekbones.\"\n\nSerana set the terms, flat and formal. \"Distance at night. Truth by day.\"\n\n\"Daylight forgives many sins,\" Nyxara said, stepping off the prettiest light to prove she could. \"I accept.\"\n\nThey filed past along the narrow path. Nyxara fell in two places back from Caelin, exactly where her perfume could find him and his eyes could find her. Durgan drifted to the tail without being told. He turned an empty palm up to the sun for a heartbeat, as if testing heat or habit, then closed it again. His shadow lay tidy at his feet.\n\nCaelin didn't relax. The plate stayed warm. The mountain waited.",

Lichens went the wrong colors—bruised blue, sour yellow—on rocks that should have held only iron stains. Pines shed needles like summer was a month too old. The air tasted faintly of ozone, then stronger.\n\n\"Key of E-flat, and rising,\" Thornik said, happy and worried in the same breath. \"That's forge-work waking.\"\n\nOn a narrow traverse, Nyxara brushed close to Vex. \"I do prefer a precarious position.\"\n\n\"Trip,\" Vex said, without looking, \"and I'll help. Down.\"\n\nThornik tried not to listen and nearly stepped off the world. Serana caught his pack strap with two fingers and hauled him straight without comment.\n\nBy noon, Caelin's pain had climbed beside him. The filaments hummed like insects under his skin. When he snapped \"I'm fine\" at Thornik's third concerned glance, the scale snapped white at the lie.\n\nA flicker of fear crossed his face before he could hide it—fear of the scale, fear of the pain, fear of what it meant that even small lies cost him now.\n\nElowen's palm hovered, and the ache drew back—but faded faster than it had that morning. The cooling lasted minutes, not the hour it had given before. She met his eyes once: not forever.\n\nHe nodded, ashamed that he'd needed it again, ashamed that it was already fading, ashamed that he resented her for the limits of what she could give.\n\nVex noticed Nyxara noticing Elowen's noticing. She filed it with the same neatness she filed other things that turned into leverage later.\n\nSerana's prayer under her breath answered in a flick of gold light that drained to cold silver before returning to nothing. She set her jaw and kept the pace. Durgan never came closer than three paces to anyone's spine. Always in sight. Never in reach.\n\nThey topped a shoulder and saw it for the first time: far above, a dark seam in the cliff face, too clean for weather, too large for any lair a sane world would house. Caelin felt meaning rise from it as if someone had pressed a hand against glass—his mind the other side.\n\n\"Later,\" he told it, which was a lie of tone rather than fact. The scale let it pass.\n\n\n\nThey found shelter in a drake-cut alcove where wind had polished the arch smooth. Over the entrance, shallow-carved characters lay like old ribs. Caelin cocked his head until the meaning clicked.\n\n\"Speak true or speak not at all,\" he translated.\n\n\"Not a compulsion, then,\" Vex said. \"A dare.\"\n\nThornik coaxed a sullen fire with his striker, which pop-banged once before deciding to behave. \"Controlled pop,\" he said, eyebrows a little shorter.\n\nHe rummaged in his pack, produced a dented kettle with far too many hinges, and perched it over the flame. The contraption wheezed, whined, and finally surrendered a thread of steam.\n\n\"Family recipe,\" he declared, pouring a swallow of something that smelled like boiled tar. \"Miners swore by it. Or swore at it. My uncle drank it daily and lived to seventy, which is either proof of its medicinal value or the reason he collapsed under a tunnel. Hard to say. Anyway—tea.\"\n\nThey sat in a loose circle. Nyxara chose a spot naturally equidistant from Caelin and Durgan, like a needle between magnets. Serana's gaze moved over their faces and found enough resolve to speak like a commander.\n\n\"If we're to risk dying together,\" she said, \"we should know who we're dying beside.\"\n\nThe Shares\n\nThornik began like a flood and ended like a dam. \"Clan chased dragon-forges. Granddad bled his journals into maps no one believed. I'm here to prove he wasn't mad.\"\n\nHe looked surprised at the neatness of his own summary.\n\n\"Look at that,\" Vex said. \"Brevity. It suits you.\"\n\nThe scale held a steady coal-glow through Thornik's words. Enthusiasm, yes. Lies, no.\n\nSerana clasped her gauntlets in her lap. \"I swore the Oath of Dawn. To protect the living. To preserve the balance. To stand where others fall.\"\n\nHer gaze flicked toward Caelin's forearm, then dropped back into ritual cadence.\n\n\"Since Thornwick, the counsel at my altars has... conflicted.\" A pause that cost. \"I haven't known silence since I was twelve. Now I can't tell which voice to obey.\"\n\nThe scale answered with gold light—then flared a white spark when she stepped around something, a failure or a choice she didn't name.\n\n\"Better practiced than unmeant,\" she said to Vex's arched brow, and looked back into the fire.\n\nNyxara's gaze flicked toward her, soft with something that might have been pity or calculation; it was hard to tell which.\n\nDurgan stared into the coals like they were a road. \"Soldier. Empire fell. Traveled. Now here.\"\n\n\"Empire,\" Thornik said carefully. \"Which one?\"\n\nDurgan didn't answer. For a split second his eyes unfocused, seeing something that wasn't the fire. His hand, resting on his knee, clenched into a fist so tight the knuckles went white.\n\nThen it passed. He uncurled his fingers deliberately, one at a time.\n\nThe shadow at his feet rippled a fraction off the fire's logic and settled.\n\nCaelin thought he saw the plate go darker—not black-violet, not the Seal's bruise, just a momentary deepening—and then it was gone, like a breath refused.\n\nVex's mouth twitched but she said nothing, knife spinning lazy circles between her fingers. Mysterious isn't the same as interesting, her expression said, but she kept it to herself.\n\nNyxara watched Durgan as if he were a riddle she'd enjoyed before and meant to enjoy again.\n\nElowen folded her hands. \"I studied endings until my circle called it wrong. Rot feeds growth. The forest hurts. I go where it hurts.\"\n\nHer tattoos pulsed a soft, truer green in the saying; the mountain seemed to breathe easier for a heartbeat.\n\nThe scale warmed gently—no sting, no show.\n\nSerana's eyes lowered, not in reverence but envy of that simple, certain faith.\n\nVex stared at her own dagger point, turning it between thumb and finger. \"Pass,\" she said. \"My business is mine.\"\n\n\"We know you're here for answers about your mother,\" Caelin said quietly.\n\nSomething sharpened behind Vex's mismatched eyes. \"Fine. She hunted the Concord. The Peaks took her or hid her. Her notes point here. I mean to find the rest.\"\n\nShe stopped cleanly, like a blade finding a sheath.\n\nThe scale snapped white.\n\nShe glanced at it and didn't flinch. Caelin held her gaze for a beat longer, a silent question passing between them. Why lie when we all know the truth?\n\nShe held his stare, unflinching. Because it's mine to carry.\n\nHe nodded once and moved on.\n\n\"Your jewelry doesn't like that answer,\" he said neutrally.\n\n\"My jewelry is knives,\" she said, and smiled without humor.\n\nNyxara tipped her head toward the lintel's warning—Speak true or speak not at all—as if accepting a dare.\n\n\"Courts hire the curious,\" she said, words like lace running over wire. \"Patrons cherish them. I collect secrets no one else can keep. Nine arts, nine lights; I favor the ones that bend.\"\n\nShe lifted her gaze to Caelin. \"Where will breaks, the soul breaks with it. That's where I walk.\"\n\nThe scale began to spark—restless, trying to pin her down and failing. Too smooth; too well-dressed. Truths thread through lies thread through truths until the weave refused to sit still.\n\n\"Which patron?\" Serana asked, voice flat.\n\n\"The kind that appreciates discretion,\" Nyxara said sweetly. \"You'd enjoy him the least.\"\n\nVex snorted. \"At least you're entertaining. Don't stab us in the back and we'll get along.\"\n\n\"I never stab,\" Nyxara said, and let a smile finish the sentence for her.\n\nAt last the circle turned the other way.\n\nCaelin had known this moment would arrive all day; dread still found a way to surprise him.\n\n\"Exiled for visions,\" he said. \"Wandered. Thornwick by—\"\n\nThe scale flared white-hot, cutting him off. He grimaced, jaw tight against the pain. \"Not chance. The dragon called me. The Ember chose me.\"\n\nHe bared his forearm to the fire—hex plate lying flush with skin, hair-fine filaments lacing to the elbow. The ember-motes inside the obsidian drifted like slow stars.\n\n\"I didn't ask for this,\" he said, low. \"But it won't let me walk away.\"\n\nThornik leaned forward, goggles twitching as if they wanted to be part of the conversation. Elowen did not stare; she had already decided the mark was a wound, not a wonder. Durgan catalogued angles—entry, exit, where a blade would need to land to sever tendon without killing.\n\nCaelin tried not to see it.\n\n\"Truth by day,\" Serana said softly, and let the subject rest.\n\nFor a moment none of them moved, each trapped in their own reflection of the firelight: six faces, six burdens, one lie each refusing to surface.\n\nThe wind found the mouth of the alcove, humming low through the carved warning above them.\n\nIt wasn't a voice, not yet.\n\nBut it sounded like one learning the shape of their names.",

The air grew thicker, harder to pull into lungs that had forgotten what sea-level felt like.\n\n\"Higher we go, the more the world decides we're guests,\" Thornik muttered, adjusting his pack straps for the third time in an hour.\n\n\"Unwelcome ones,\" Vex added.\n\nFar ahead, the path bent out of sight—light thinning, sound thickening.\n\nThe air changed—metallic on the tongue, like a coin held too long.\n\nDust lifted off the floor in a slow breath that belonged to nothing living.\n\nSerana's wardlight thinned to a bruised milk color, then steadied. She frowned, adjusting her grip on the hilt at her side.\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words, nothing more.\n\nCaelin felt the scale tighten under his skin—warning without pain, just a steady pressure that said pay attention.\n\nThey rounded a bend where the lantern halo met shadow.\n\nAt first it was just darkness pooling where it shouldn't—a trick of the stone, a hollow catching less light. Then it moved.\n\nShadow rose before the wall could cast it—slick, jointed, learning how to stand.\n\nWhen it spoke, three voices braided together: the person it had been, something ancient and patient, and beneath both a sound like stone grinding on stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" it said. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\n\"Company,\" Vex murmured—already moving, already small, body language shifting from traveler to predator in a heartbeat.\n\n\"Hold,\" Serana said, her tone a blade laid flat.\n\nThornik didn't look up from his satchel. \"Short fuse, low yield. Nobody breathe wrong.\" His hands moved with practiced speed, assembling something small and precise.\n\nNyxara's smile was silk over wire. \"Do try not to die. I just learned your names.\"\n\nCaelin's scale flared black-violet at the edges—corruption warning, irregular pulse. The thing ahead wasn't just shadow. It was wrong, fundamentally displaced from what should be.\n\nHe drew heat and starved it—no blaze, just a hard, white line along his palm. Focused. Controlled. The kind of fire that cut instead of consumed.\n\nThe scale approved with pain—a sharp spike through the filaments that made his vision narrow for a heartbeat.\n\nHe let the line kiss the rising shadow at what passed for an ankle.\n\nIt shrieked in three registers at once and stumbled—more insult than injury, but it moved. The shadows comprising its form scattered like startled birds, then regathered with visible effort.\n\nSerana lifted her hand and set a ward between the thing and Elowen—a square of clean gold light that held.\n\nFor a heartbeat her jaw clenched, eyes gone distant, as if listening to a voice that couldn't agree with itself. The ward flickered—silver-gold-silver—then stabilized.\n\nIt didn't fail. It shook, then set.\n\nThornik rolled a thimble-sized charge underhand. It coughed instead of boomed—pure percussion, designed for enclosed spaces.\n\nThe tunnel answered with a slap of echo that flattened the shadow's edges, forcing definition where it wanted to remain formless.\n\n\"Acoustic shear,\" he said, delighted even in the midst of danger. \"Knew it would work.\"\n\nVex went low and left, a quick insult of steel that took what counted for a heel. The shadow recoiled from the touch of worked metal, hissing.\n\nNyxara didn't bother to draw a weapon; she spoke a word that bent the angle of the lantern-light. Reality twisted—just slightly—and suddenly light existed where it shouldn't, casting shadows that trapped the thing from three impossible directions.\n\nThe shadow flinched from light that shouldn't have existed there.\n\n\"Transposition,\" she said mildly, as if naming a wine.\n\nThe thing collapsed back into behaving shadow, dragging a cold with it that wasn't temperature so much as absence—the feeling of standing where something warm used to be.\n\nIt said nothing more. It only learned the shape of their fear and thinned into the wall, leaving frost patterns that hadn't been there before.\n\nSilence returned in pieces—first to the floor, then to the air, then, last of all, to their breathing.\n\nCaelin flexed scorched fingers. The scale's ember settled from angry red back to steady coal-glow—account tallied, for now. The pain lingered, a reminder of the cost.\n\nSerana's light guttered and steadied; she didn't move her hand until it stopped shaking. When she lowered it, her palm was pale, fingers trembling almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"Next time we turn back,\" Vex said, wiping steel on her cloak.\n\nNo one agreed. No one disagreed.\n\nDurgan watched the wall where the shadow had gone, eyes unreadable. His own shadow lay perfectly still at his feet, patient as stone.\n\n\"Not a voice,\" Thornik said softly, more to himself than the others. \"Not yet.\"\n\nThey moved on, slower, as if the tunnel might listen for names they hadn't meant to give.",

The air thickened, dry as powdered bone. Their own heartbeats became percussion.\n\nSerana's wardlight threw their shadows forward in tall, twitching columns that moved just slightly out of sync with their steps.\n\nVex stopped once, hand on wall. \"There's warmth under the stone,\" she said.\n\n\"Residual energy,\" Thornik answered, consulting a brass thermometer from his pack. \"Or a warning.\"\n\n\"Feels like both,\" Elowen murmured, her fingers resting against the basalt. The green of her tattoos pulsed faintly, then dimmed.\n\nThe passage ended in a smooth half-circle of carved basalt.\n\nAcross it, nine sigils burned faintly—shapes that refused the eye, looping back on themselves like reflections in a warped mirror. They seemed to shift when looked at directly, settling only when viewed peripherally.\n\nCaelin's plate flared in response, ember light threading through his forearm in sympathetic rhythm—bright warm pulse of recognition.\n\n\"Same count,\" Thornik whispered, voice hushed with awe. \"Nine arts, nine lights.\"\n\nNyxara reached toward the nearest sigil; the air hissed like cooling iron.\n\n\"Touch nothing,\" Serana said, sharper than she meant to. Her hand had moved to her sword hilt by reflex.\n\nCaelin felt words form in his mouth unbidden—language without thought, pulled from the scale's memory rather than his own.\n\n\"Work done under one sky...\"\n\nThe glyph nearest him brightened, then went still.\n\n\"...so all may breathe.\"\n\nThe hum in the floor deepened; stone resonated like a held note. The other sigils pulsed in sequence, one after another, acknowledging the words.\n\nNot a trap. Not quite permission either.\n\nSomething in between—recognition.\n\nThornik crouched, goggles gleaming in the sigil-light. \"Pressure wards tied to tonal frequency—song as lock. Brilliant. Grandfather mentioned these but I thought—\"\n\n\"Meaning you can open it?\" Vex interrupted.\n\n\"Meaning it might open us instead,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nNyxara's lips curved. \"Some doors require confession. Others, blood.\"\n\nSerana shot her a look. \"We'll start with faith and see where it fails.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—red to gold to violet—cycling through colors like breathing. For a breath the world went quiet inside Caelin, the constant ache fading to nothing.\n\nHe saw the sigils as living veins, the mountain's pulse running slow beneath his feet. Connections spreading out like roots or arteries, feeding something vast and sleeping.\n\nThen it passed, leaving a metallic taste behind his teeth and the ache returning sharper than before.\n\n\"Something knows we're here,\" he said.\n\n\"We made sure of that,\" Durgan replied, eyes on the sigils.\n\nThe first sigil turned liquid, sinking into the stone like water into sand. A seam appeared, exhaling a draft that smelled of dust, smoke, and memory—air that hadn't moved in centuries suddenly set free.\n\nSerana's wardlight flared in answer—reflex, not choice—steady gold for three heartbeats before settling back to her trained discipline.\n\nWhen the glow settled, a corridor sloped downward, lined with facets that caught and bent their torchlight until it shimmered like water over stones.\n\n\"Going in?\" Vex asked. \"Or waiting until it eats someone braver?\"\n\nThornik was already adjusting his pack. \"I vote in. If it eats me, document the process.\"\n\nNyxara smiled. \"I do like an optimist with an expiration date.\"\n\nSerana drew her sword. \"Light first, words after.\"\n\nCaelin stepped forward, because something in the hum expected him to. The flame-path in his vision led straight down that corridor, bright as a wire pulled taut.\n\nThe air inside the new passage moved with a slow, deliberate rhythm—breathing, but not with lungs. Something mechanical, ancient, still keeping time.\n\nBehind them, the sigils dimmed until only one faint ember remained—the one Caelin had spoken to.\n\nThe mountain had accepted their offer, or marked it.\n\nEither way, it had listened.\n\nThey set watches in pairs, because Serana refused not to. The encounter with the shadow-thrall had proven they couldn't afford to be caught unprepared again.\n\nCaelin with Vex, Serana with Thornik, Elowen with Durgan—because someone had to, and because Durgan's earlier warning still sat in everyone's mind: I can walk with you, or I can follow you. If I follow, you won't know where I am when you sleep.\n\nBetter to know.\n\nCaelin and Vex took the first hours. The flame-path was a bright wire across his sight even in dark; it tugged like it had hands, patient and insistent.\n\n\"Your scale went supernova for the warlock,\" Vex said, quiet enough to be courtesy.\n\n\"She's hiding,\" Caelin said. \"So is everyone else.\"\n\n\"You included,\" Vex said. \"You sparked on 'chance.'\"\n\n\"This thing makes lying impossible,\" he said, looking at his forearm where the plate pulsed soft coal-light. \"Even to myself.\"\n\n\"Must be exhausting,\" she said without malice, and they watched the stars try not to freeze.\n\nAfter a while, Vex spoke again, softer. \"She went looking for this. My mother. Same mountains, same ruins, same stupid pull toward things that should stay buried.\"\n\nShe didn't look at him, just kept her eyes on the dark.\n\n\"Her notes stop at 'fire-kept covenants.' Just... stop. Like she found what she was looking for and it erased the need to write anything else.\"\n\n\"Or she couldn't write anymore,\" Caelin said, then wished he hadn't.\n\nVex's jaw tightened. \"Yeah. Or that.\"\n\nThey sat with that truth until their watch ended.\n\nSerana and Thornik took second watch. Serana prayed without sound, lips moving through familiar cadences. Thornik tried not to hum back to the tuning fork's itch in his bones, but occasionally a soft note would escape, harmonizing with the mountain's deep resonance.\n\n\"Do you hear it too?\" he whispered. \"The way the stone... sings?\"\n\n\"I hear my goddess,\" Serana said. \"Or I used to.\"\n\nThornik looked at her, then back at his instruments. \"That's... I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't be. Doubt is a kind of clarity.\"\n\nElowen settled near the mouth with Durgan because someone had to. She watched the outline of dead needles against a blade of winter moon. He didn't move except to breathe. His shadow might have shifted. Or the fire might have guttered. Or both.\n\n\"I saw it,\" Vex whispered from her roll, not quite asleep.\n\n\"Shadows crawl when embers sink,\" Serana said steadily from her watch.\n\n\"Parallax,\" Thornik muttered, caught between sleep and waking. \"Warm air vent. Looks like movement when it isn't.\"\n\n\"There is no wind,\" Elowen said.\n\nNo one spoke after that. The fire sank. So did certainty.\n\nNyxara did not sleep. She sat half-lidded, facing the invisible wire only Caelin could see. The air around her kept that one-beat lag, like a dancer listening to a different drummer. Occasionally her lips would move, shaping words no one else could hear—communing with something that answered in silence.\n\nThe ground thrummed once, deep enough to belong to bones. Stone ground stone somewhere below—one heavy beat like a chain tugged and made to hold. Thornik's kit began to hum to the same pitch, all at once—every metal piece resonating in sympathy.\n\nThe scale throbbed angry red though Caelin had cast no magic, breath catching in his throat as pain spiked without warning.\n\nEveryone who had been asleep woke with weapons to hand. They listened until the mountain went quiet again, which is a different quiet than before something happens.\n\n\"Something knows we're coming,\" Caelin thought, and the thought did not feel like his alone.\n\nThey banked the coals and waited for dawn.",

                "text": "ACT VI: THE LONG NIGHT\n\nThey walked until their torchlight shrank to islands in a black sea.\n\nWhen Thornik called halt, no one argued.\n\nThey chose a chamber where the ceiling arched low and the air at least pretended to stay still—a bubble of relative safety in the mountain's throat.\n\nFire wouldn't take at first; the damp stone ate sparks with patient hunger.\n\nThornik muttered equations until the tinder surrendered, coaxing flame through sheer engineering stubbornness.\n\nVex set her back to a wall and unwrapped dried meat with the deliberation of someone daring it to complain. Each movement precise, controlled—the way she did everything.\n\nNyxara brushed dust from her coat as if dirt were an opinion she disagreed with.\n\nDurgan took no watch post; he simply stood at the chamber's edge, shadow even and patient, eyes reflecting firelight like a cat's.\n\n\"Quality lodgings,\" Vex said, breaking the silence. \"I give it one star—half if something bites me.\"\n\nThornik gestured grandly at the faint fire. \"Central heating included. Indoor plumbing is extra.\"\n\nSerana's smile almost happened, then didn't. The corner of her mouth lifted for half a heartbeat before something pulled it back down.\n\nCaelin caught the half-moment and felt its absence like weather changing—the way you\n\nknow rain is coming before the first drop falls.\n\n\n\nCaelin took first watch. The flame-path in his vision had dimmed to a fine pulse, like a heartbeat under frost—present but muted, patient.\n\nSerana joined him without being asked, sitting a pace away where the light touched both of them but left space between.\n\nFor a while neither spoke. Then Serana's hand moved to her pendant—the sunburst symbol of the Silver Dawn—and her lips shaped words he couldn't hear.\n\n\"Guide me,\" she whispered—habit, not plea.\n\nSilence. Then, faint as breath: two threads twined into one voice.\n\nShield the bearer. Offer the bearer.\n\nHer chalk snapped in her hand.\n\nCaelin turned. \"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She brushed the dust away, steady but not steady enough. Her fingers trembled as she gathered the broken pieces.\n\nHer wardline brightened and held—a thin circle of gold light around their small camp—but her voice didn't.\n\n\"Rest isn't surrender,\" she said, echoing Elowen's words from earlier, and looked at the fire until the words meant something again.\n\n\"Your goddess,\" Caelin said carefully. \"She's still speaking?\"\n\n\"Two of her are,\" Serana said, so quietly he almost missed it. \"And they can't agree.\"\n\nShe stood then, ending the conversation before it could go deeper. \"Your watch ends in two hours. Wake Thornik.\" Then she moved to her bedroll, lying down with her back to the fire.\n\nBut Caelin saw her hand go to her pendant again. Saw her lips move in prayer.\n\nSaw nothing answer.\n\n\n\nWhen she rose to change shifts, Durgan replaced her without sound.\n\nVex hadn't slept. \"You don't blink much,\" she said from her bedroll, eyes reflecting firelight.\n\n\"Wastes moisture,\" he replied.\n\n\"That supposed to be funny?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe rolled over. \"Good. I'd hate to think you had hobbies.\"\n\nHis shadow stretched toward the fire, then back—just a flicker, barely noticeable. Could have been the flames. Could have been something else.\n\nDurgan's hand went to his nose—checking, the gesture automatic now—but came away clean.\n\nNot yet, he thought. But soon.\n\n\n\nElowen woke at the change in sound; the mountain had exhaled differently. A shift in the air pressure, or perhaps just her nature-sense responding to something the others couldn't feel.\n\nShe found Caelin still by the fire, staring at his hand as if deciding who it belonged to.\n\n\"If it spikes, don't ask me to take it,\" she said softly, settling beside him.\n\nHe blinked. \"You were the one who offered.\"\n\n\"I can carry it,\" she said. \"But it carves me out to do it. Like pouring clean water into a cracked cup and finding the puddle is me.\"\n\nA breath; the faint scent of scorched green rose from her skin and vanished. The blackened edges of her tattoos were more visible now in the firelight—the price of easing his pain accumulating in her flesh.\n\n\"Save me for when you're dying,\" she finished. \"Not for when you're hurting.\"\n\nHe nodded. It wasn't agreement so much as acceptance of debt. Understanding that her gift had limits, that asking too often would break her.\n\n\"How long?\" he asked. \"Before it's too much?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said honestly. \"The forest doesn't count days. It counts seasons. Endings.\" She smiled, sad and small. \"I'll know when I know.\"\n\nThey sat together until her watch came, and she moved to take position at the chamber mouth, humming that tune again—the one that sounded like growing things deciding whether to live or die.\n\n\n\nThornik sat hunched over a sketchbook, coal-smudged and muttering, trying to capture the geometry of the nine sigils before memory faded them.\n\nNyxara watched from across the fire, head tilted with the curiosity of a cat observing a particularly interesting insect.\n\n\"You always measure the world?\" she asked.\n\n\"Only what tries to kill me. Helps with repeat attempts.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"And if it succeeds?\"\n\n\"Then my notes survive.\" He tapped the journal. \"Someone smarter than me can learn from my mistakes.\"\n\n\"Ambitious corpse,\" she said, and turned her gaze to the glowing coals as if reading her own epitaph there.\n\n\"What about you?\" Thornik asked, surprising himself with the boldness. \"Does your patron get your notes when you die?\"\n\n\"My patron gets everything,\" Nyxara said lightly. \"That's rather the point of patronage.\"\n\n\"And you're fine with that?\"\n\n\"I've been fine with it for quite some time now.\" Her smile didn't change, but something in her eyes did—something old and resigned and perhaps a little sad. \"Long enough to know the bargain was worth it. Long enough to know the price hasn't come due yet.\"\n\nThornik wanted to ask more, but something in the way she looked at the fire told him the conversation was over.\n\n\n\nBy the time last watch came, the fire was a red pupil in the dark.\n\nEach of them had taken their turn at silence and found it too loud.\n\nSerana's wardline ringed the camp in a thin, wavering halo; now and then it flickered like breath caught mid-prayer. Each flicker lasted longer than the last.\n\nThe hum returned—deep, bone-slow, curious.\n\nIt moved through the stone beneath them and counted heartbeats.\n\nSeven.\n\nSeven hearts beating in the dark. Seven souls climbing toward something that watched and waited and remembered when the world was younger.\n\nWhen it passed, the silence it left behind didn't feel empty.\n\nIt felt patient.\n\nCaelin lay in his bedroll, eyes open, watching the shadows dance on the ceiling. The scale pulsed in time with his heart—soft coal-glow, steady and eternal.\n\nSomething knows we're coming, he thought again.\n\nAnd this time, the thought came with a response—not words, not quite, but a presence acknowledging him. Recognizing him.\n\nWaiting for him.\n\nFar below, deeper than any tunnel they'd yet walked, something shifted. A chain pulled taut, tested its links, and held.\n\nAnd in the perfect darkness of that deep place, something counted.\n\nThud.\n\nThe sound was too deep for ears, felt in bone and blood.\n\nThud.\n\nSeven hearts beating above.\n\nOne heart—if it could be called a heart—beating below.\n\nThud.\n\nCaelin's hand went to his forearm, pressing against the embedded plate as if he could stop what was coming by holding it still.\n\nThe scale pulsed back at him—not warning, not comfort.\n\nJust recognition.\n\nYou're expected, it seemed to say.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to sleep, knowing he wouldn't.\n\nThe mountain breathed around them. Patient. Eternal.\n\nListening.\n\n\n\nEND CHAPTER 4\n\n\n\nWord Count: ~13,800 words",

                "text": "ACT I: THE CORRUPTED\n\nThe mountain smelled of hot stone and a kiln that had just shut its mouth. Caelin woke to Vex's palm over his mouth, her other hand clamped to his shoulder.\n\n\"Don't make a sound,\" she breathed. \"Company.\"\n\nThe scale in his right forearm tightened its pulse, not warning, not ease—just braced. Coal-glow slid toward ember-red; the fine obsidian filaments beneath his skin crawled up toward the elbow like roots searching stone.\n\nFrom the lower passage—the one they'd marked with chalk and left closed—voices braided the air. Wrong, guttural, harmonized like things that had practiced speaking together inside the same throat.\n\n\"Ember-born...\"\n\n\"...the chain calls...\"\n\n\"...submit or be consumed...\"\n\nVex's hand left his mouth. \"Up,\" she hissed, and the camp came alive in a soft clatter of straps and breath.\n\nSerana rolled to her feet, sword in one hand, the other kindling silver-gold. The light stuttered gold→silver→gold—a tremor she smoothed with breath. Thornik's pack went from hum to urgent whine as needles spun. Elowen's vine-marks dimmed to a determined green. Nyxara stood in a movement that wasn't one, purple aura guttering like a candle in wind. Durgan took the choke point, blades bare, shadow pooled neat at his boots—too neat.\n\n\"Signatures?\" Vex murmured.\n\nThornik checked a gauge that vibrated his teeth. \"Multiple. Same resonance as Thornwick—stronger. Focused.\"\n\n\"They'll smell the Ember,\" Nyxara said, eyes on Caelin's arm. \"A bonfire in a dark valley.\"\n\n\"Can you dim it?\" Serana asked, already moving to shield the center.\n\n\"No.\" He'd tried. White sparks punished lies, and it punished denial just as fast.\n\n\"Then we work with it,\" Serana said. \"Caelin center-back. I hold the line. Thornik on my flank, steel first, toys second. Vex wide right. Elowen disrupt their approach. Nyxara—\"\n\n\"I'll... persuade,\" Nyxara murmured, voice a soft knife.\n\nDurgan didn't wait for orders. \"They know exactly where we are,\" he said, jaw tight. \"Kill fast, before the trap closes.\"\n\nThe voices fell silent. The air drew a breath.\n\nBy first light that never reached this deep, the tunnels had learned their names.\n\nThe hum settled to a floor-note you only noticed when it stopped.\n\nIt stopped.\n\n\n\nDust lifted off the stone in slow spirals, then hung as if waiting to be told where to fall.\n\nVex's hand found the wall. \"Metallic again,\" she murmured. \"Coin on the tongue.\"\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words. Nothing more.\n\nSerana's wardline thinned to chalk-pale, then steadied.\n\nCaelin felt the scale tighten—warning without pain, the kind that comes just before it hurts.\n\nThe chamber ahead was the shape of a held breath.\n\nShadow clung to the facets and then decided to stand.\n\nFive of them—wrong-jointed, glass-slick, learning their limbs like newborns. They moved like puppets given too many strings. Joints bent a fraction wrong. Skin was the color of cold parchment, stretched and shifting over bones that didn't respect anatomy. Eyes were black from lid to lid—no iris, no white, just void that stared back.\n\nTheir shadows moved first, crawling toward Caelin's arm with hungry, fingered curiosity.\n\nWhen they spoke, three voices braided through each throat: the people they had been, something ancient and patient, and beneath both the grind of stone on stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" they said together. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\n\"Line,\" Serana said, sword low. \"Light, then edges. No heroes.\"\n\nThornik palmed two charges. \"Edges I have. Heroes, sadly, I left at home.\"\n\n\"Left,\" Vex snapped, already moving.\n\n\"Right,\" Nyxara echoed, voice silk over wire.\n\nCaelin took center because the path in his bones put him there.\n\nThe scale's edge bloomed black-violet—ink spreading through obsidian water—and snapped back to red-gold. It hurt different this time: not the compressive burn of claiming, not the constant ache he could now ignore. This was a hook, barbed and patient, tugging along the filament lattice as if it could pull the Ember out of him with steady, surgical malice.\n\nHe staggered. Elowen caught his shoulder. \"I can sense it,\" she said, voice tight. \"A severing. I can't ease this.\"\n\n\"Then we break the hand holding the hook,\" Serana said, and ran.\n\nHe drew heat and starved it to a hard white seam across his palm, then cut the closest shadow at the ankle.\n\nIt shrieked in three registers and folded—but did not die.\n\nPain lit the scale a murderous red. He kept his hand closed anyway.\n\nSerana hit them like a wall of weather. Shield-first, a ward-wave plowing the nearest thrall backward so hard its shadow recoiled, hissing. Her sword came down in a clean kill-line—\n\nHer lips moved—automatic prayer, the kind learned in bone.\n\nThe answer struck from two mouths at once.\n\nProtect the flame.\n\nBreak the vessel to save the flame.\n\nHer wardlight guttered, flared, guttered. Blood salted her tongue.\n\n\"Choose,\" she hissed—to the voices, to herself. The blade came up anyway. \"Fine. I choose now.\"\n\nShe stepped in and set her sword through the thing's shoulder—and met resistance like cutting water that didn't agree to be cut. Light seared black flesh; it didn't fall. It grinned too wide—teeth blooming like fungus where a mouth should stop.\n\n\"Hard to kill!\" she called.\n\n\"News flash,\" Vex said, already gone from where she'd spoken.\n\n\"Duck,\" Thornik said, and rolled a thimble charge.\n\nIt coughed instead of boomed; the echo slapped the chamber flat.\n\nThe shadow's edge tore like wet paper where the sound hit it.\n\n\"Acoustic shear,\" he breathed. \"Repeatable.\"\n\nShe was a blur on the fringe: two quick stabs behind a knee and a tendon, twist and away. The thrall buckled correctly—then its shadow lashed like a whip and caught her across the ribs.\n\nVex hit stone, slid, swore without wasting air. \"Shadows bite! Noted!\"\n\nVex went low, a fast insult of steel at what passed for a heel. \"Trip the legs, quiet the mouth.\"\n\nNyxara didn't draw. She spoke a word that bent the lantern-angle; light arrived from the wrong direction.\n\nThe shadow flinched from illumination that shouldn't exist there.\n\n\"Transposition,\" she said, almost kindly. \"Stand in your proper place.\"\n\nThornik roared—a sound that came from under mountains—and hit the hamstrung thrall with two axes like punctuation. Steel met neck. Head rolled. Its shadow screamed like glass breaking underwater and blew away.\n\n\"One!\" he bellowed, beard alight with reflected ember.\n\nNyxara didn't shout. She breathed, and indecision bloomed in two corrupted minds. One raked at the wrong air where Caelin had stood; the other hesitated in a three-second loop of doubt.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, soft but absolute.\n\nSerana obliged. Silver-gold through the throat; the shadow boiled like ice in summer and was gone.\n\nThe fourth rose for Vex's throat.\n\nDurgan was there. No shout, no flourish—steel where it had to be. His forearm took the rake that would have opened her.\n\nHe shoved it back two steps and did not pursue.\n\nThe last turned from the fighters and stretched too many fingers toward Caelin.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" three voices purred. \"The chain is mercy. Let us hold your fire. We will take the pain away.\"\n\nThe scale chose.\n\nHeat flowered in his chest like a furnace door thrown wide. It wasn't temperature; it was pressure finding a path. His right arm lifted with a puppet's surety. Obsidian hex flared white. The lattice lit like molten wire from palm to collarbone.\n\nHe didn't aim. Didn't choose. The Ember chose him as an answer.\n\nRed-gold plasma ripped the air. Granite vitrified to glossy black where it touched. The smell hit hard—hot glass, burnt ozone, iron filings on the tongue.\n\nThe thrall didn't burn. It unmade. Flesh evaporated. Bone sifted to ash. The shadow screamed in three notes and was not.\n\nThree seconds. Then the door slammed shut.\n\nPain took the room.\n\nThe remaining shadows collapsed into behaving dark, dragging cold with them that wasn't temperature so much as absence.\n\nThey said nothing more. They only learned the shape of the group and thinned into the walls.\n\nSound returned in layers—first to the floor, then to the air, then, last of all, to breath.\n\nCaelin flexed scorched fingers. The scale tallied pain and settled to coal-glow.\n\nSound wavered, distant and too loud. His heart rattled a panicked rhythm. The plate in his arm dropped from white-hot to furious red, the filaments pulsing like infected seams. His lungs forgot how. He went to a knee on a floor that looked like a mirror still cooling.\n\nElowen was there, palms hovering. Green light reached for him—and guttered, the smell of scorched leaves sharp and wrong. A thin edge of one vine-mark blackened on her skin as she pulled back.\n\n\"I can't,\" she whispered, horrified. \"Post-cast residue burns my connection. I can ease your baseline, not this.\"\n\n\"S'okay,\" he managed through his teeth. \"You told me.\"\n\nVex slid in hard, fingers at his pulse, pupils, breath. \"Not dying,\" she said briskly. \"Shouldn't cast again for hours—maybe a day—unless we want him to.\" She made a leveling motion with her hand. \"You know.\"\n\nHer joke was a little too thin to be a joke. He almost laughed anyway.\n\nSerana kept her hand on the ward until it stopped shaking. When she finally sheathed the blade, her mouth was set against words.\n\nVex wiped her knife clean and didn't thank Durgan. She didn't not thank him, either.\n\nNyxara smoothed her coat as if dirt were an opinion, then watched Serana a fraction too long.\n\nThornik counted fuses he hadn't used and grinned like a man who'd just learned his math could kill.\n\nHe glanced at Caelin’s arm—coal-glow again, the ember-motes drifting slow. “Back to baseline,” he said, as if noting a reading. “Coal means steady. Ember-red means spent. Black-violet means—” He stopped himself. “Well. We know what black-violet means.”\n\nAt the mouth of the passage, Durgan hadn't moved an inch. He kept the retreat open, blades ready—eyes trained not on the dark beyond, but on the lattice burning under Caelin's skin. His shadow flexed like a dog that had caught a scent. He flattened it with will and left crescent bruises through his trousers where his fingers anchored him.\n\nThe hum returned, deeper, almost pleased.\n\n\"Not a voice,\" Caelin said, listening to the stone. \"Not yet.\"",

Her jaw tightened. \"No. Not with a beacon on two legs. I hate the idea, but... containment.\"\n\n\"The Undervault,\" Thornik offered, already pulling the battered journal from his coat. Pages crackled, stained with old blood and older ink. \"Pre-Concord passages. Old dwarf-wards. My grandfather mapped entries and marked the Deep Hall. Wards there might confuse whatever is sniffing us.\"\n\n\"Safer for civilians,\" Serana said, jaw set. \"Not for us.\"\n\nElowen's gaze went inward, the way it did when she listened to the Weave. The green of her tattoos pulsed faintly, then dimmed. \"The deep places are hurt. Wounded things can be generous. Or angry.\"\n\nDurgan's fingers twitched toward a blade, then away—a motion so fast only Vex caught it. \"Safer to be hunted in stone than among farms.\"\n\nThey looked to Caelin.\n\nThe scale warmed—not push, not pull. Waiting.\n\nHe thought of Thornwick. Of glass bones where houses had stood. Of Mira's small hand clutching his ruined cloak.\n\n\"Undervault,\" he said. \"We don't bring this down to doorsteps.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" Thornik said, already shouldering weight, adjusting straps with practiced efficiency. \"I've always wanted to risk my life on decayed ventilation and ancestral pride.\"\n\n\"Lead on,\" Vex said, checking her daggers with methodical precision. \"If a ward eats us, I'm haunting you.\"\n\n\"Queue forms to the left,\" Thornik said, finding his cheer again despite everything. \"Ancestral disapproval is first-come, first-served.\"",

The breath of the Undervault tasted of iron, dust, and old smoke that had forgotten its fire.\n\nA tight spiral took them down past shelves of fossilized lichen that glowed just enough to make shadows mean. The scale's coal-glow mixed with green-blue, turning everything a strange bruised purple. Their boots found perfect dwarf-cut treads, each one precisely placed, worn smooth by centuries of use. Breath plumed in the cold.\n\nThey came to a three-way junction.\n\nThornik thumbed brittle pages, following his grandfather's diagrams with one finger while holding his lantern close. \"Left is sealed. Collapse, bad air, and a page of do not in runes only grandmothers use.\" He squinted at faded ink. \"Right's toward the forges—likely flooded. Straight is the Deep Hall. Strongest wards. Multiple exits.\"\n\n\"'Should be' is the most dangerous phrase,\" Vex muttered, testing the air currents with a wetted finger.\n\n\"Aye,\" Thornik said cheerfully. \"Shall we?\"\n\nThey walked until silence felt heavier than noise.\n\nThe mountain had gone from predator to cathedral—huge, patient, and indifferent.\n\nEvery sound came back doubled, as if the tunnels were practicing conversation.\n\nBy the time they moved again, their footsteps felt borrowed.\n\nThe bridge waited with the patience of stone made to sing.\n\nBelow, the dark had depth—thick enough to hold a choir.\n\n\"Single file,\" Serana said, testing the first plank with her boot. \"Slow. No idle noise.\"\n\nThornik swallowed a theory about resonant architecture. Vex swallowed a curse about trusting ancient engineering.\n\nDurgan said nothing and stepped where he was told.\n\nThe first footfall rang a low bell—pure, round, unhurried.\n\nThe second answered a third below, like harmony remembering itself.\n\nBy Caelin's fourth step the bells had learned his weight and offered a scale that climbed in perfect intervals.\n\nThe plate in his arm kept time despite him, pulsing in rhythm with the bells—coal-glow brightening fractionally with each step.\n\nHalfway across, Nyxara's heel grazed a loose shard.\n\nThe note that answered came bent, then split into two, then four—ugly, eager, dissonant.\n\nThe span trembled. Cracks webbed outward from where her foot had landed, then held—barely.\n\n\"Don't improvise,\" Vex hissed without turning, knuckles white on the rope.\n\n\"Tragic,\" Nyxara said, adjusting her footing with careful precision. \"I excel at it.\"\n\nFrom the chasm rose an answering chord—soft at first, then full enough to live in. Harmonics layered upon harmonics, building a cathedral of sound in the empty air.\n\nElowen's eyes went wide. \"Roots sing under storms,\" she whispered. \"This isn't that.\"\n\nThornik's hand hovered over his tuning fork, then curled to a fist. \"This is engineered. Intentional. The entire bridge is an instrument.\"\n\nCaelin tasted metal and old ash. The scale warmed without pain, as if listening back, recognizing something in the music.\n\nThey reached a split in the span: two narrow runs diverging for ten feet before rejoining, creating a gap where no single person could span both paths.\n\n\"Pairs, or it drops us,\" Thornik said, staring at the bell spacing carved into each path. \"It wants balance, not mass. Weight distribution.\"\n\n\"Vex with Nyxara,\" Serana ordered, already assessing. \"Thornik with me. Caelin in the center. Durgan anchors.\"\n\nVex clicked her tongue. \"You do love a trust exercise.\"\n\nNyxara smiled. \"I adore being trusted.\"\n\nDurgan took the rear without comment, his shadow pooling perfectly still despite the chasm wind.\n\nThe twin paths learned their pairs fast—two notes for each step, tuned just off a perfect fifth. When Serana's breath hitched mid-crossing, her note wavered. The bridge shuddered.\n\n\"Hold,\" Caelin said—more plea than order.\n\nShe held. The bells forgave her, the dissonance resolving back to harmony.\n\nA hairline seam opened under Vex's foot without warning.\n\nShe didn't scream; she vanished down to the knee, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Her knife hand caught stone, blade sinking into a crack with desperate precision.\n\nNyxara didn't reach for her. She changed the angle of her shadow with a subtle gesture, fingers tracing sigils in the air.\n\nFor one breath, light came from the wrong direction; the stone remembered being whole. The seam closed just enough.\n\nVex kicked free, hauled up with trembling arms, swore once—the rare, sincere kind that meant actual fear.\n\nBehind them Durgan's note didn't change. He hadn't moved. Hadn't even shifted his weight.\n\nThe last bell rang itself when Caelin stepped off the stone, a final perfect tone that lingered in the air long after it should have faded.\n\nAhead, the corridor opened into a dome vast enough to hold weather.\n\nNine pillars ringed the space, each cut with a different pattern of facets that caught light and swallowed it. They didn't glow. They absorbed.\n\nThe quiet here was thicker than dark.\n\n\"Resonant sink,\" Thornik breathed, voice dropping to a whisper instinctively. \"It drinks sound.\"\n\n\"Then whisper,\" Vex said. \"Or think louder than you speak.\"\n\nSerana's wardlight dimmed to a candle's stubborn core. \"This place keeps oaths. Or breaks them.\"\n\nNyxara walked the nearest pillar, fingertip hovering, never touching. \"Nine doors that forgot they were doors.\"\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words. Nothing more.\n\nThe plate brightened from coal to ember.\n\nNot pain—attendance.\n\nCaelin laid two fingers against the nearest pillar. It did not warm. It did not sing.\n\nIt remembered a heat so old the stone no longer called it heat.\n\nIn that heartbeat he saw a hand not his own pressing this same facet; a voice not his own saying a name he didn't know how to repeat. The vision smelled of forge-fire and ozone, tasted of copper and purpose.\n\nHe pulled back. Taste of copper. Taste of thunder about to happen.\n\n\"I think it knows the order,\" he said. \"I don't.\"\n\nA note rose from somewhere beneath the dome—lower than any bell on the span, the kind that rearranges ribs and makes bones remember they're temporary.\n\nThe nine pillars answered by not answering. Each drank the sound and gave back silence, creating a void where the note should have echoed.\n\n\"Echoes below,\" Thornik said, instruments beginning to hum in sympathy.\n\n\"Not echoes,\" Elowen murmured, one hand pressed to her sternum as if feeling the vibration there. \"Something that expects us.\"\n\nThey stood in the quiet a moment longer, counting breaths they hadn't meant to hold.\n\nThen the pull in Caelin's arm tightened, and the path chose left.",

                "text": "ACT IV: DEEP HALL\n\nThe Deep Hall opened not gradually, but all at once—as if a cathedral of stone had been hiding an arm's length beyond the dark.\n\nPillars like old oaks rose from an obsidian floor polished to mirror. Bas-reliefs coiled up each: dwarves and dragons working side by side; forges burning in colors metal shouldn't make; the nine pedestals carved and blessed, each one distinct in its geometry. At the crown of every pillar, chains looped around a shape no artist would define—something that might have been a lock, or a heart, or both.\n\nAlong the walls, nine alcoves expressed their schools in stone:\n\nEvocation: facets that multiplied light until it looked like heat, angular and aggressive.\n\nAbjuration: nested bevels, each guarding the next in concentric protection.\n\nConjuration: empty arches promising somewhere else, frames without destinations.\n\nDivination: spirals your eyes couldn't follow without falling, probability made geometry.\n\nEnchantment: curves that made attention lean, seductive and subtle.\n\nIllusion: surfaces that adjusted when you didn't look, never quite the same twice.\n\nNecromancy: a hollow; an absence; a worn edge where something used to be.\n\nTransmutation: rough stone flowing to glass mid-surface, frozen mid-change.\n\nDestruction: edges broken on purpose to prove a point, jagged and defiant.\n\nIn the center, a round granite table big enough for a parliament. Dust softened the shine. No footprints but theirs.\n\n\"The wards held,\" Thornik breathed, watching his scanner's needles settle to a calm green. \"Active peace. Saints and stone—this place is safe.\"\n\nSerana still paced the perimeter—old habits dying hard. Her light swept high vaults and alcoves; nothing moved but breath and dust motes dancing in the ward-glow. Vex tested for pressure plates out of reflex, found none. Elowen's voice came out as reverent as prayer. \"Stone remembers bargains.\"\n\nDurgan paused at the threshold. The carved runes flickered—curious, then tolerant. \"Uncomfortable,\" he said honestly, and crossed. His shadow tried to widen past his boots; the ward-light nudged it back like a shepherd dog redirecting wayward sheep. He set his jaw. It obeyed.\n\n\"We rest,\" Serana decided. \"Pairs on watch. No solos.\"\n\nThey burned a small, clean fire in a shallow stone cradle with invisible vents—Thornik tapped the pillar and grinned: \"We make smoke go where we want. Grandfather's diagrams called this 'breathstone.' Channels run through the walls.\"\n\nThe air tasted faintly of oil and old ash; fresher scents—leather, metal polish, juniper from a scrap of kindling—cut through the mineral cold.\n\nThey ate dried meat and hard cheese. They checked steel, adjusted straps, cleaned blades. They didn't talk much at first.\n\nCaelin sat with his back to a pillar beneath Evocation, watching the facets multiply the firelight into something that looked almost like the flames he carried. The scale had cooled to its steady coal-glow; the constant ache was back—the kind Elowen could ease when it wasn't fresh-burn. He flexed his hand. The lattice answered, not offended, not appeased. You'll know when you can pay again, it seemed to say.\n\nHe hoped his body would warn him before his bone-marrow did.\n\n\n\nFirst Watch: Caelin & Vex\n\nThey kept it simple: steel on knees, backs to stone, ears tuned to the empty halls. The scale pulsed with his heart, ember drifting like slow fish under dark glass.\n\n\"That thing is you now,\" Vex said, not unkind, studying the plate where it lay flush in his skin. \"Optional to like it. Not optional to learn it.\"\n\nHe huffed a laugh. \"It calls me out when I lie. When anyone does.\" He nodded at his arm. \"White spark. Like thorns under the skin.\"\n\n\"Handy and infuriating.\" She studied him with those mismatched eyes. \"For what it's worth—you didn't hesitate when it acted. Courage or stupidity.\"\n\n\"Which do you vote?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She eased a breath around her ribs, wincing slightly. \"Brave people do stupid things with better reasons.\"\n\n\"And you joke so you don't scream.\"\n\n\"Don't get romantic. Joking also annoys monsters.\"\n\nThe scale stayed quiet. Truth accepted.\n\nThey sat in companionable silence after that, listening to the fire pop and the mountain breathe.\n\n\n\nSecond Watch: Serana & Thornik\n\nSerana's hands rested in prayer form, fingers laced. No words came. Her lips moved occasionally but made no sound. Thornik pretended to tune his scanner while watching her not-pray.\n\n\"Still split?\" he asked gently after a long silence.\n\n\"Protect yesterday. Sacrifice today.\" Her mouth crooked, humorless. \"I can follow orders. I cannot follow contradictions.\"\n\n\"In a good system, contradictions signal a changed input.\" He tapped his grandfather's journal. \"He wrote: Balance isn't the absence of cost. It's paying without bankrupting the world.\"\n\n\"Doesn't make it easier.\"\n\n\"No,\" Thornik said softly. \"But it makes it necessary.\"\n\nHer light flickered gold→silver→gold again; she steadied it with a breath and nodded, accepting the truth if not the comfort of it.\n\nThey sat watching the shadows dance on ancient carvings, and neither spoke of the weight they carried.\n\n\n\nThird Watch: Nyxara & Elowen\n\nSilence sat between them like a cat that owned the room.\n\n\"Your magic is... angled,\" Elowen said at last, breaking the quiet.\n\n\"So is yours,\" Nyxara replied, head tilted with feline curiosity. \"Yours bends toward growth and cycles. Mine bends toward... consent, of a kind.\"\n\n\"Do you trust it?\"\n\n\"Trust implies parity.\" A small, tired smile. \"I honor the bargains I make.\"\n\n\"I'm losing ground,\" Elowen said softly, touching the edge of the blackened vine-mark with careful fingers. \"When he casts, I can't help. I burn.\"\n\n\"Then plan for loss,\" Nyxara said. Not cruel. Precise. \"Decide who you are when the Weave doesn't answer.\"\n\nElowen looked at the Necromancy alcove without fear, studying the hollow where something had been carved away. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Decide anyway.\"\n\nA frost halo settled on Nyxara's lashes for a heartbeat and melted, leaving tiny droplets like tears that weren't.\n\nElowen noticed. Said nothing.\n\n\n\nFourth Watch: Durgan (breaking the pair rule)\n\nHe took the arch alone and didn't wake the person assigned to him. Not defiance—necessity. When he slept, his shadow got ideas.\n\nHe kept it small, neat, obedient by force, the way you keep your breathing even under a predator's gaze. The scale's distant glow tugged at his periphery like a road that always slopes downward, whispering promises in a language he refused to learn.\n\nWalk away, a voice inside offered. Lose yourself in the dark. Stop being a danger.\n\nHe didn’t. Instead he squeezed four half-moons into his thigh through wool and felt the pain anchor him. Added four more next to the earlier set, a constellation of control etched in bruises.\n\nHis shadow moved anyway.\n\nNot far—an inch, maybe two, stretching toward the coal-glow at the edge of Caelin’s bedroll. He caught it the moment he felt the resistance ease, snapped it back with a breath so sharp it hurt his chest, and held it there. It obeyed. Barely.\n\nHe made reaching boring. Made it cost. But it had moved on its own, and they both knew it.\n\n\"How long,\" he thought, not asking anyone, \"before I can't hold it still?\"\n\nThe ward-lines along the threshold pulsed once—assessing, not judging. They recognized restraint when they saw it.\n\nHe didn't move.",

                "text": "ACT V: THE LONG ASCENT\n\nCaelin woke to a sound his bones recognized before his mind did.\n\nThud.\n\nNot weather. Not rockfall. The counting of something chained far below.\n\nThe scale answered with a brighter coal-glow; ember drift quickened inside the obsidian. Around the circle, heads lifted one by one. The sound came again, nearer—or just more focused, as if attention had turned their direction.\n\nThud-thud-thud-thud—\n\nThornik's needles jittered from calm green to anxious yellow. \"Movement. Multiple. Below us. Above us. Possibly... through us?\"\n\n\"Any other good news?\" Vex asked, already on her feet, daggers appearing in her hands.\n\n\"The ventilation is superb,\" Thornik said, shouldering his pack with practiced speed. \"And I'm very attached to my head.\"\n\nFrom the three corridors—the sealed, the flooded, the safe—stone began to move. Grinding. Opening. The air drew a breath that wasn't theirs.\n\nSerana rose fully armored, sword in hand, voice calm to keep the pulse down in others. \"We move now. Thornik on point. Same formation. If a ward asks for courtesy, we give it. If something tries to herd us—\"\n\n\"We bite the hand,\" Vex said, rolling a shoulder and wincing as her ribs protested. \"Then run.\"\n\nCaelin stood. The ache was a live thing in his bones. Elowen's palm hovered near his arm—she tested the air for fresh-burn and found none. Relief drifted in like cool rain; the pain stepped back a pace, manageable again. He swallowed gratitude, because speaking it would make it real, and he didn't know how many more times he'd get it.\n\nDurgan slid to rear-guard. His shadow pooled obedi—\n\nNo. It pressed at the edges like tide against a seawall. He smoothed it with breath and didn't look at Caelin, didn't acknowledge the way it wanted to reach toward the coal-glow in the dark.\n\nNyxara passed the Evocation alcove and paused for a heartbeat, head tilted. The scale gave a silver shimmer—a brief halo that said another magic is looking back. She smiled to herself and moved on.\n\nThey stepped toward the straight corridor. Behind them, in the polished seal of the Deep Hall's floor, their reflections delayed by a single blink—there, then gone, as if the stone was deciding whether to remember them.\n\nThe heartbeat below picked up, counting them like beads on a string.\n\nThey went up.\n\n\n\nThey moved quickly after that, not running—no one wanted to find out what would give chase—but with the shared precision of people who'd heard a door close behind them and didn't know whose house they were in.\n\nThe tunnels felt steeper on the way out, as if the mountain had grown new muscles while they weren't watching. Gravity pulled harder, or perhaps exhaustion made it feel that way.\n\nWalls that had been smooth now carried shallow grooves—fresh, unfinished work, stone still warm under fingertips that brushed too close.\n\nThornik muttered calculations under his breath, consulting his instruments. \"Stress fractures don't self-heal. Something's rewriting geology.\"\n\nVex: \"Tell it to stop.\"\n\n\"Would if I knew the syntax.\"\n\n\"Try screaming louder.\"\n\nShe smiled. No one else did.\n\nAt the first junction they hit a dead end that hadn't existed before. The floor sloped upward in a spiral of newly-cooled glass, the surface too perfect to be natural, too warm to be old.\n\nSerana touched the seam where new met old. \"It's sealing itself behind us.\"\n\nNyxara looked at the closing curve, studying it with professional interest. \"Or ahead of us. Perspective is the first casualty of divine architecture.\"\n\nCaelin set his palm against the wall; the scale pulsed once—recognition, not alarm. \"It's guiding, not trapping.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Vex said, checking over her shoulder at the way they'd come. \"Until it stops.\"\n\nThe second tunnel forked into shadow. A draft hissed through like breath through teeth, carrying the smell of deep earth and older dark.\n\nSerana drew light. It came thin and trembling, barely enough to push back the shadows.\n\nShe tried again. The radiance stuttered, guttered, and went out like a candle in wind.\n\n\"I... can't feel the source.\" Her voice was calm because she'd trained it\n\nto be, but her hand shook slightly before she lowered it.\n\nNyxara's reply was all sugar. \"You're running on faith, darling. Check your reserves.\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Caelin's tone cut sharper than intended. The warmth of the scale spilled into his voice, unasked. \"She's tired, not empty.\"\n\nSerana looked at him—really looked—and he saw in her eyes the flicker of gratitude and shame tangled together like roots and chains.\n\n\"I'll manage.\"\n\nShe didn't.\n\nThey climbed a narrow chute where the roof had already dropped its first warning stones—small ones, pebbles that clattered down like dice announcing the mountain's intentions.\n\nThornik went first, hammering pitons into half-molten rock with steady, practiced strikes. Each blow echoed differently, telling him what the stone would hold and what it wouldn't.\n\nHalfway up, the air shifted—pressure collapse, no sound, just a sudden absence—then the wall shuddered.\n\nCaelin felt the pull in his arm flare white-hot. \"Move!\"\n\nThey ran on instinct. The rear half of the tunnel folded inward, stone sighing like something exhaling dust and disappointment. Rock met rock with the sound of finality, sealing the way they'd come.\n\nWhen the noise settled, the way back was gone.\n\nThornik stared at the new wall, panting. \"Correction: rewriting geology in real time.\"\n\nVex pressed her hand against the fresh barrier. Still warm. \"So we go forward or we stay here until we're decoration.\"\n\n\"Forward,\" Serana said, voice steady though her light had guttered out entirely. \"Always forward.\"\n\nThe climb stole what little rhythm remained in their breathing.\n\nCaelin's right arm ached with the memory of the sigils—hot where the rest of him was cold. The filaments crawled beneath his skin like they were searching for something they'd lost.\n\nElowen fell into step beside him without being asked. \"You're shaking.\"\n\n\"It's the pull.\"\n\n\"Then push back.\"\n\nHe managed a half-laugh. \"That easy?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"But start somewhere.\"\n\nShe brushed her hand near his sleeve; the ache dulled. Not gone—just bearable. The green of her tattoos flickered, dimmed slightly, another small price paid.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Later,\" she said. \"When we're out.\"\n\nBehind them Nyxara glanced at Durgan's shadow—still too obedient, too smooth, like a dog trained to sit perfectly still while its master walked away.\n\n\"You hear it too?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"The hum?\"\n\nHe shook his head once. \"Footsteps.\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. Didn't look at her. Just kept walking with that deliberate, measured pace that suggested if he stopped, he might not start again.\n\nWhen she looked again, his shadow was holding perfectly still while his boots moved—a fraction too much control, the kind that comes from fighting something every single second.\n\nAt last the tunnel widened enough for rest.\n\nThornik struck a flame that barely caught, nursing it like a dying thing. The light painted their faces in ochre and exhaustion, hollowing cheeks and deepening shadows.\n\nVex divided rations without asking; she had counted before anyone noticed they were running low. Dried meat, harder cheese, a swallow of water each. She moved with the efficiency of someone who'd learned hunger as a child and never forgotten the lesson.\n\nSerana knelt apart, tracing the sigil of her order in ash on the ground. The mark wouldn't hold shape. The dust slid away from her fingers as if the mountain itself rejected the prayer. She tried again. Again the ash refused her.\n\nCaelin watched but didn't interrupt.\n\nSome prayers, he thought, were best left unanswered.\n\nA faint tremor moved through the stone like a muscle tensing.\n\nTheir gear jingled once, softly.\n\nThen the hum changed key—dropping a full tone, deeper, more present.\n\nThornik's head snapped up. \"That's not us.\"\n\nElowen closed her eyes, listening with her whole body the way trees listen to approaching storms. \"Something old is turning over in its sleep.\"\n\nVex sheathed her knife slow, deliberate. \"Let's not be the alarm clock.\"\n\nThey climbed the last stretch in silence.\n\nSnowlight filtered down from a crack above—thin, colorless, precious as air. The temperature dropped with every step, breath turning to visible ghosts in the suddenly frigid air.\n\nWhen they emerged onto open rock, the air hit like resurrection: cold, clean, cruelly bright after so long in the dark.\n\nCaelin turned back once. The tunnel mouth had already begun to glass over, edges smoothing and sealing, faintly glowing from within with a light that pulsed in time with the distant counting below.\n\nHe couldn't tell if it was sealing itself shut or lighting a path back.\n\nEither way, it watched them go.\n\n\"The mountain remembers,\" Elowen whispered. \"Question is—what?\"",

                "text": "ACT VI: THE SUMMIT'S SHADOW\n\nWind met them like a blade honed on snow.\n\nThe world was all angles—black rock, white glare, a sky so close it felt like a lid pressing down on the peaks.\n\nBreath came thin and loud in their own ears, each inhalation a small victory against the altitude.\n\nThe ridge ran like a spine, dropping to glazed couloirs on either side—sheets of ice that fell away into clouds and nothing. One wrong step and gravity would have opinions.\n\nFar ahead, the flame-path in Caelin's vision brightened to a fine wire, then split along the crest—two threads, left and lower, right and steep.\n\nHe blinked; the right-hand thread tugged harder. Not safer. Just certain. The kind of certainty that didn't care about safety.\n\n\"Two ways,\" he said.\n\n\"Then there's only one,\" Vex answered, already squinting into the glare, reading the terrain with the practiced eye of someone who'd survived by always choosing the less-bad option.\n\nSunlight cut through high cloud and made three mock-suns at the horizon—halos stacked like coins, a parhelion that shouldn't have been so clear at this time of day.\n\nFor a moment the middle ring threw nine spokes across the glare, a trick of ice crystals and angle.\n\nThey watched until the spokes thinned and died, melting back into ordinary light.\n\n\"Pretty,\" Thornik said, too softly. \"I hate it.\"\n\n\"Atmospheric phenomenon,\" Vex said. \"Ice crystals refracting—\"\n\n\"I know what it is,\" Thornik interrupted. \"Doesn't make it less ominous.\"\n\n\"Light for the edge,\" Serana said, lifting a hand as they prepared to traverse the exposed ridge.\n\nNothing came.\n\nShe breathed, steadied, tried again. The wardline stuttered and guttered like breath caught in a throat, flickering silver-gold-silver before dying completely.\n\n\"Source is... thin,\" she said, voice even by force of will. \"Can't hold it.\"\n\nNyxara's smile didn't travel to her eyes. \"Altitude does that to certainty.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Caelin said—quieter than anger, firmer than plea. \"We move slow. No miracles, just rope.\"\n\nSerana nodded once and lowered her hand. That, too, was a kind of prayer—accepting limitation, working within it.\n\nThey roped in—Thornik's knots neat as script, each one tested twice. Vex testing every anchor with insults and physics, trusting neither completely.\n\nThe ridge narrowed to two boot-widths and a faith wider than comfort.\n\nDurgan took rear without comment. He walked like a man who had been here in other lifetimes and found the drop repetitive. His shadow stayed small, obedient, costly.\n\nHalfway across, a gust hit sideways—a wall of wind with malice in it. Elowen's heel skated on rime; Caelin felt the rope jar tight across his chest, fibers groaning.\n\n\"Lean in,\" he said, not sure who needed it. Maybe himself.\n\nThey did. The gust passed. The ridge became a ridge again.\n\nNyxara altered the angle of her shadow with a single, almost lazy wrist-turn—subtle magic, barely noticeable.\n\nFor one breath the glare softened where their eyes needed it most, giving them a moment of relief from the sun-blindness.\n\nVex saw it and didn't comment. She only moved faster, wanting to be off the exposed spine before the mountain changed its mind.\n\n\"Shelter,\" Durgan said, three heartbeats later.\n\nNot warning. A direction.\n\nThey followed his chin-tilt to a bite taken out of the lee side—a snow-scooped alcove backed by stone, protected from the worst of the wind.\n\nThey crouched out of the wind, bodies grateful for even this small mercy. Fire was a joke up here where oxygen barely existed; Thornik didn't try. They huddled together for warmth instead.\n\nSerana sat with her back to rock and closed her eyes like someone setting down a weight too heavy to carry any longer.\n\nCaelin heard the whisper before he saw her jaw tighten—the overlapping threads of two instructions that would never agree, playing in an endless loop.\n\nProtect the flame.\n\nOffer the bearer.\n\nHer fingers found the chalk tucked in her belt and snapped it cleanly in two. The pieces fell into the snow and were immediately buried by a fresh gust.\n\n\"I can walk,\" she said, eyes still shut. \"I can't promise more.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Caelin answered.\n\nHe didn't add, For now.\n\nVex distributed a stingy fistful of dried fruit as if paying out wages. \"Don't die; I'll have to redo headcount.\"\n\nThornik chewed slowly, trying not to look at the halos still staining the horizon like cosmic warning signs. \"Quantitatively speaking, we're under-supplied on miracles.\"\n\nNyxara watched the way the wind curled around Caelin's forearm, as if the air had opinions about ownership. \"Quantitatively speaking,\" she murmured, \"we're over-supplied on audience.\"\n\nDurgan didn't sit. His shadow behaved itself. That felt like a decision that cost him.\n\nThe ridge underfoot hummed—two notes a tone apart, beating slow against each other in a rhythm that made teeth ache.\n\nThornik touched stone with a bare palm. \"That's not weather.\"\n\nElowen listened with her whole body, the way she'd learned to read the forest's moods. \"Something turned over below us.\"\n\n\"Left,\" Caelin said. The pull in his arm was no longer a suggestion. It was a command.\n\nNo one argued.\n\nThey moved into a light that felt older than noon, shadows stretching wrong directions, the sun pale and distant.\n\nThe mock-suns had faded, but the taste of metal hadn't—copper and ozone, the flavor of lightning about to strike.\n\nBehind them, the wind erased their prints in a single pass, as if the mountain wanted no record they'd been there.\n\nAhead, the path narrowed and began to sing—a low, thrumming note that rose from stone or sky or the space between.\n\nSerana opened her hand for light one more time and found none. She closed it before anyone saw, fingers curling into a fist.\n\nBut Caelin saw. And said nothing.\n\nBefore they moved, Vex ran her count aloud—four charges spent, one blade chipped, three wounds that needed proper dressing when there was time. Thornik tapped the scale of remaining fuses against his thigh: six left. Elowen said nothing, but turned one wrist up; two more vine-marks had darkened at the edges, thin black lines where the green should have been. Serana’s wardlight was gone and hadn’t come back.\n\nCaelin looked at his arm. Coal-glow. Steady. Not spent, not surging—just present.\n\n“Still here,” he said, to no one in particular.\n\nThey descended.",

                "text": "ACT I — HOLDING PATTERN\n\n\n\nThe Deep Hall received them without ceremony.\n\nCaelin stepped through the threshold and felt the mountain’s weight lift—not gone, just redistributed, traded for the particular stillness of a space that had been holding its breath for centuries. His lungs remembered how to fill. The ache in his arm didn’t disappear, but it quieted, as if even the scale understood that something here predated its urgency.\n\nThen the scale of it arrived. Pillars like old oaks, an obsidian floor that held their torchlight and gave it back doubled. Nine alcoves ringed the walls, each one a different geometry of purpose. The ceiling arched into dark too high to read.\n\n“Saints and stone,” Thornik breathed, the words barely a sound.\n\nNobody told him to be quiet. The Hall already had that covered. There was a hum here—low, below hearing, felt in the soles of the feet rather than the ears—and it wasn’t welcoming exactly. It was the hum of something that had been here long before them and expected to be here long after. They were guests. The kind the house had been built to receive, but guests nonetheless.\n\nThey moved inward, and the dark closed behind them like water.\n\n\n\nDawn came thin and blue through the Deep Hall’s lichen glow, turning the carved pillars the color of frost-bitten iron. The air tasted clean here—cold stone, a thread of old forge-heat sleeping beneath it, and the faint chalk-dry tang of runes that still remembered their purpose.\n\nThey moved like people who had run out of adrenaline and were now running on decision.\n\nThornik was already at the central table, grandfather’s blood-marked journal pinned open under a gear clamp. Brass goggles perched on his forehead, he traced bas-reliefs with a smith’s reverent fingers: dwarves and dragons bent over the same anvil; nine pedestals lifted into place; an undefined chained shape ringed by wards.\n\n“Forge Road,” he murmured, beard-braid ticking against his lip as he measured spacings by thumb-width. “Here. Vent shafts run parallel to it—old draught chimneys for the caldera. If anything still breathes down here, it breathes along those lines.”\n\nSerana chalked a sigil on the stone just inside the threshold: nine quick strokes, intersecting arcs that looked wrong until they clicked into simple harmony. The chalk squeaked; the symbol caught the lichen-light and held it, no divine sheen, just stubborn geometry.\n\n“Secular ward,” she said when Caelin looked a question at her. “Old templar trick. No god required—only ratios and repetition.” She dusted her hands, leaving white on steel-callused palms. “It won’t stop a determined thing. But it notices what crosses.”\n\nElowen lowered herself beside the mark and pressed two fingers to the stone. The vine-ink along her arms pulsed a steady emerald with new threads of silver braided through—the Deep Hall’s abjurations still singing inside her since she’d touched the shields yesterday.\n\n“It listens back,” she said quietly. “Like a skin wound scabbing—the Weave remembers the shape of whole. These lines help it hold.” Her smile was small, an apology to the mountain. “For a time.”\n\nAcross the table, Caelin worked with his right hand open over a dented tin cup. The scale in his forearm sat at coal-glow, ember-motes drifting slow beneath obsidian like fireflies behind tinted glass. He called a tight needle of heat—less than a candle—and warmed the cup just enough to steam the water without boil. A second thread of focus: a bent pack-buckle on Serana’s strap, heat-softened, thumbed true, cooled with a breath.\n\nThe filaments under his skin tugged, then settled. Pain: there, but manageable. Like wearing boots a size too small and learning to walk anyway.\n\n“Keep the increments small, the cost small,” he said, mostly to himself. He tried a third exercise: a flat of cold ash on an iron pan, coaxed to lift in spirals, then allowed to fall in his open palm until it sketched Draconic for breathe in soot. The lattice stung once—needle-pain, warning accepted.\n\nNyxara watched, her expression the unreadable calm of someone who’d seen a hundred magics and kept score. The tips of her fingers were darker today, necrotic black like frostbite that had learned a language. She pulled her sleeves down without comment and leaned on the table as if the stone and its memory pleased her.\n\nDurgan stood with his back to a ribbed pillar, shadow lying neatly at his feet, hands loose, eyes far. He kept glancing to the chalk sigil at the threshold and then away, as if looking at a knife and deciding not to pick it up.\n\nVex was already moving, energy channeled into usefulness. She tested the Hall’s margins, checked for pressure plates that didn’t exist, and returned with three serviceable torches scavenged from niches high on the wall. “If the dwarves didn’t want anyone to touch a thing,” she said, “they carved it so beautifully you couldn’t help yourself. If they wanted you to live, they hid ventilation like it was contraband.” She sniffed. “Smoke goes somewhere. I approve.”\n\nThornik snorted. “Thank you. On behalf of my ancestors and basic fluid dynamics.”\n\nThey ate a cold breakfast: hard cheese that sweated fat in the chill, bread dense enough to patch a hole, dried fruit with the ghost of sweetness. The Deep Hall seemed to approve of quiet—it made their small noises clearer: the scrape of blade on stone as Serana honed an edge; the soft scuff of Elowen’s staff; Caelin’s measured breathing as he asked the Ember for one more small thing and paid for it with a pinprick of fire that didn’t quite become pain.",

If something needs unscrewing, you can talk to it.”\n\nThey took the eastern service corridor first—a low-ceilinged gallery, the stone so smooth it had forgotten it had ever been rough. The smell there was stranger: faint metal sweetness, like the air over a well-kept blade; a hum underfoot as if the rock carried a memory of current.\n\n“Residual load,” Thornik murmured, palm flat to the wall. “Conduction lines. The Hall leeches a steady trickle from micro-wards embedded in the bedrock. Old dwarven trick to keep structural fields topped.” He tapped the stone with a knuckle; the tone came back pure. “This gallery is stable.”\n\n“Good,” Vex said. “Next.”\n\nThe western spur choked almost immediately: a mining tunnel collapsed and then fused, as if heat had melted its failure into permanence. The smell was glass and dust. “Not our way,” Vex judged, crouching at the edge of a darkness that would not be argued with.\n\nThey returned to the threshold, to Serana’s chalk mark watching the doorway like a lidded eye.\n\n\n\nDurgan’s shadow moved first.\n\nIt slid a finger-length toward the sigil—not with the light’s logic, but with its own, pulled by something that didn’t care about angles or sources. The chalk lines brightened all at once, not gentle, not soft: a white-hot flare that hit the nose with scorched mineral and crisp ozone. The shadow recoiled in a visible ripple, as if fire had run through oil—fleeing back around Durgan’s boots, seething there until he crushed it flat with effort that made his jaw jump.\n\nNobody spoke.\n\nThe flare-light faded. The sigil settled back to its cold geometry. In the silence after, each of them found somewhere to look that wasn’t Durgan’s face—the pillar carvings, the floor, the chalk line itself still faintly warm. The kind of silence that isn’t absence of sound but absence of the right words.\n\nDurgan broke it. He wiped a single red thread from under his nostril with the back of his knuckle and looked at it as if surprised it existed. His jaw worked once, then settled.\n\n“It will again,” he said. “Keep the marks fresh.”\n\nSerana’s chin lifted a degree. “It noticed,” she said—not accusation, not pity. Accounting. She was already reaching for the chalk.\n\n\n\nElowen touched the stone near the burned-bright sigil without crossing it, palm flat. The silver threads in her tattoos shivered. “It hurt the wrongness without hating the person,” she said, a quiet relief in her voice. “I can feel the difference. We should lace the perimeter.”\n\n“On it,” Serana said, already pocketing the stump of chalk and breaking a fresh stick. “Corners and sightlines. Nine strokes each. We keep the geometry honest.”\n\nNyxara drifted parallel to Caelin as he cooled the buckle he’d mended. “Your restraint is very tiresome,” she observed, eyes on the faint steam. “Men half your age would already have tried to set the ceiling on fire to prove a point.”\n\n“I only just learned how much it costs,” Caelin said. He flexed his fingers, testing the lattice ache. “I can’t afford to show off.”\n\nNyxara’s smile acknowledged the answer and then filed it in a drawer marked useful. She tucked her sleeves lower. If anyone noticed the way she favored her hands, they had the courtesy not to say.\n\nThey ringed the Hall with chalk, nine-stroke sigils at each throat where a passage met the open space. The symbols gathered the lichen-light to themselves until the Deep Hall looked like a star-chart: pale constellations behind pillars and the slow, steady coal-glow of Caelin’s scale. The air tasted faintly of dusty limestone and hot flint.\n\nBy late afternoon they had a map.\n\n“Three viable routes,” Thornik said, tapping lines he’d sketched in charcoal on the central table. “Smithy run is flooded two at least two spans deep—I can hear it breathing. Mining spur is fused at the choke. That leaves us the Forge Road with a vent shaft network as auxiliary escape.”\n\n“Forge Road takes us toward the caldera?” Serana asked.\n\n“Aye. Past it. There’s a bridge and a long spiral stair to the east face. If it’s not collapsed.”\n\n“It’s not,” Elowen said, eyes half-closed as if feeling the mountain through the rock. “Stressed. Not broken. The Weave there is… tight. Like a rope under weight.”\n\n“Good enough,” Vex said. “We go at first light, when we’ve got the most in the tank.”\n\nNyxara looked back at the chalk wards tracing a new constellation around their camp. “First light it is. Assuming first light comes under a mountain.”\n\n“It does,” Thornik said. “It tastes different.”\n\n“Like what?” Vex asked.\n\n“Cold bread and old iron,” Thornik said, unhelpful and exactly right.",

Thornik leads with the map. Caelin center. Elowen behind him. Nyxara floats. We don’t stop unless we have to.”\n\n“Natural leadership,” Nyxara said. “Very stern. Do you ever enjoy hobbies?”\n\n“Sometimes I sharpen knives,” Serana said, and the tiny smile she didn’t mean to show made Nyxara’s eyes tick in amusement.\n\nVex rolled her shoulder and suppressed the flinch when pain shouted down her arm. The wound from Thornwick—stitched, scabbed, reopened, and restitched—complained like an old friend. “If anything moves in the spokes,” she said, “we don’t chase it.”\n\n“Second rules,” Thornik added. “Nobody kicks suspicious rocks, nobody licks mysterious crystals, and if a passage hums at a frequency that makes your molars hurt, you do not—under any circumstances—put your hand in it.”\n\nCaelin lifted an eyebrow. “You say that like it’s personal history.”\n\nThornik coughed. “My cousin. He no longer has eyebrows.”\n\nElowen’s gaze roved the pillars and their carved histories. She stopped at the Abjuration alcove, where bevel met bevel, each protecting the next. Her palm hovered over the stone and the silver threads under her skin gleamed once, like moonlight on a stream. “I can carry a little of this forward,” she said. “Not the strength of the Hall—but a memory of it. When it matters.”\n\n“Save it for when it matters,” Caelin said. He meant: for later, for when it really tries to kill us. He didn’t say: for when I break myself again.\n\nNyxara’s eyes slid to his hand. “You could practice one more trick tonight,” she said, and when he looked wary, added, “A small one. Helpful. Non-impressive. So you’ll agree.”\n\nHe waited.\n\nShe produced a black iron coin from a pocket, perfectly ordinary except for the faintest ring of cold around it. “Balance it an inch over your palm,” she said. “Just heat below it and a chill above. Don’t let either touch. Contain both. When you can do that, you can shape an edge in air.”\n\n“Is this you helping?” Vex asked, dubious.\n\n“This is me preventing him from burning his thumb off tomorrow,” Nyxara said sweetly.\n\nCaelin tried. It was a child’s parlor trick, cruelly difficult. He built the narrowest pedestal of warm air he could manage and coaxed the coin up on the eddy, then called a breath’s worth of cold to sit on it. The filaments under his skin whispered complaint but did not scream. The coin wobbled. Settled. Wobbled again. Balanced.\n\nHe let it drop into his palm and counted the cost. Small. Acceptable.\n\n“Clever,” he conceded.\n\n“I’m full of surprises,” Nyxara said. Her smile showed no teeth.\n\nThey set watches in pairs.\n\n“Don’t stand alone,” Serana said. Her tone made it order, not advice.\n\nDurgan nodded once and didn’t argue, which told Caelin more than if he had.",

                "text": "ACT IV — THE WEIGHT OF THE WATCH \n\n\n\nThe Deep Hall breathed.\n\nIt wasn’t sound so much as pulse—a slow press and release through the pillars as if the mountain remembered tides. The chalk sigils held their cold stars at the thresholds; the lichen dimmed and brightened with a rhythm that matched no heartbeat the living could claim.\n\n\n\nFirst watch: Thornik and Serana made quiet rounds, counting pillars, counting breaths. Once, far off in a side tunnel, a pebble clicked.\n\n“Guide me,” Serana whispered, just under breath. The reply came in a forked whisper that wasn’t wind.\n\nShield the bearer.\n\nOffer the bearer.\n\nHer chalk snapped in her fist. Thornik looked over; she kept her face neutral, thumb dusting grit from her glove as if that had always been the plan. The ward line brightened, steadied. Her voice did not.\n\nSerana’s hand went to the sword; Thornik’s to the little hammer at his belt. Nothing came.\n\n\n\nSecond watch: Vex and Caelin.\n\nThey sat with their backs to opposite sides of a pillar, daggers and dragonfire keeping each other honest. Vex sharpened a blade with habitual precision. Caelin balanced Nyxara’s black coin an inch above his palm, let it spin like a planet on a column of warm air while a whisper of cold kept it from wandering.\n\n“Your shoulder?” he asked without looking.\n\n“Attached,” she said. “Functional. I complain later.”\n\n“You could let Thornik rebind it.”\n\nVex made a face in the dark and then softened it because there was no one to see. “He fusses.”\n\n“He cares.”\n\n“That’s worse.”\n\nThey sat a while longer, the coin circling in the slow orbit of the too-careful, the scrape-scrape of steel on stone marking seconds. Finally Vex said, low: “You do know this ends badly, yes? The relics. The Seal. Threads like these don’t tie themselves into bows.”\n\n“I know.” Caelin didn’t let the coin fall. “I don’t know what it looks like when it ends. But I know it isn’t clean.”\n\n“That’s the first sensible thing you’ve said since Thornwick.” She breathed out, not quite a laugh. “Keep saying sensible things, Ember-boy. It helps.”\n\n\n\nThird watch: Nyxara and Elowen.\n\nThey kept companionable silence for a long time, because both understood that speech could wake grief and they needed sleep more than they needed philosophy. When Nyxara finally spoke, it was to the chalk mark nearest the Necromancy alcove.\n\n“Your threads are brighter,” she said.\n\nElowen glanced down at the silver braided through her vine-ink. “Borrowed,” she said. “I’ll pay back the interest.”\n\nNyxara tipped her head. “It hurts when you try to ease him now.”\n\n“Yes.” Elowen’s smile was almost tender, as if at a child learning to walk. “So I won’t try unless I must.”\n\n“You’ll be tempted,” Nyxara said.\n\nElowen didn’t deny it. “I will.”\n\n\n\nFourth watch: Durgan and—by Serana’s assignment—Thornik. Except Thornik fell asleep sitting up with his chin on his chest, grand plans finally overridden by tired biology. Durgan didn’t wake him.\n\nHe stood alone with the chalk sigil’s white geometry and his shadow.\n\nIt began as a suggestion. The shadow stretched until it kissed the threshold line, then curled away like a cat from a hot stove. He felt the push—the thing in him testing, calculating. He breathed. Held. Pressed it flat.\n\nA vision slid across his awareness without knocking.\n\nThe central table. Caelin asleep on a bedroll, scale bare in the low light. Durgan’s hand on a knife. Four steps. Kneel. Angle of blade: shallow and long to avoid arteries, deep enough to free the hex, twist at the notch—\n\nHe jerked back into himself with a soundless gasp, hand already halfway to his belt. He closed his fist on empty air until pain brought him back into the body that had not moved.\n\nA hot line opened under his nose. He wiped the blood on the heel of his palm and watched it dry black in the lichen light. Minutes between episodes now. Hours before. Days once.\n\nHe stepped deliberately backward from the chalk and stared at the pillar carvings until the urge lost its edges.\n\n“I will walk away before I can’t stop it,” he told the stone under his breath, and the mountain, practical and ancient, declined to promise anything.\n\n\n\nThe breathing of the Hall changed around false dawn. Not louder—quicker. Someone turned over in a bedroll and muttered a name. The lichen dimmed, then steadied.\n\nCaelin woke from a dream that was only a pressure: Thud. Not near. Not far. Not a heart but something that had decided the rhythm of a heart was a good lie. Once, twice, and then nothing, as if it had leaned close to listen and then, disappointed, moved on.\n\nHe sat up, coin in his palm, and didn’t practice again. The lattice hurt the way fresh bruises hurt. Useable. Unwise.\n\n\n\nThey rose before the Hall would have called it day. The fire-pit stank of cold ash and juniper resin; the chalk sigils were still bright but scuffed at two thresholds as if something had pressed there and reconsidered.\n\nIn the far curve of the vaulted ceiling, a hairline crack ran through one of the load ribs—fine as a drawn thread of ink, barely there, the kind of thing that meant nothing until it meant everything.\n\nNo one looked up.\n\n\n\nThey packed as quietly as seven people could. Straps pulled snug. Knots retied. The last of the water parceled and swallowed. Serana walked the perimeter and refreshed each ward with a careful ninth stroke. The chalk squeaked in the silence.\n\nThat was when the first sound came from the tunnels: a patient scrape like metal testing stone, answered a long moment later by a tapping from the sealed mining spur, and then the slow rhythm of water displaced where none should be moving.\n\nVex’s head came up. “Company,” she said, voice flat.\n\n“Positions,” Serana returned, already in motion. “We move on Thornik’s mark.”\n\nHe lifted the lantern, checked the charcoal lines on the table one last time, and pointed toward the passage that would feed to the Forge Road.\n\n“Here,” he said. “Before the mountain decides for us.”\n\nThey stepped into the breath of the Hall and felt it hold and release around them like a lung that knew their weight and had decided—just this once—to wait.",

With the light came the low sound—felt first in teeth, then in boot-soles, then up through the ribs.\n\nThud.\n\nA breath-long pause—did you imagine it?—then:\n\nThud.\n\nThe ward-line held under Serana’s palm—chalk geometry and nine-stroke precision, the sigils she’d drawn before sleep still bright enough to matter. They stole some of the bass out of the air, damping the pulse like thick velvet over a drum. Not all of it. Not anymore.\n\nScrape from the forge corridor. Tap-tap at the sealed mine. A wet drag through floodwater that should have been still for centuries. The mountain answered with another dull knock that belonged to no mortal heart.\n\nThud.\n\nCaelin woke to that slow count and the smell of old smoke and cold iron. The scale in his forearm held its coal-glow, the pulse tightened—not warning, not ease—like a hand at the small of his back urging him forward. The familiar ache had settled in overnight to its hateful normal. He flexed carefully. He could manage small work today—if he paid every time.\n\nSerana kept her hand on the runes. No prayer came. Nothing answered. The chalk held because chalk didn’t need permission—only ratios and repetition and the stubbornness of someone who hadn’t stopped yet. “They’ve ringed the entrances,” she said, voice low and steady. “We don’t wait to be tested to failure. We choose our ground.”\n\nVex was already up, knives in hand, standing where the Illusion alcove threw tricky reflections into the corners. \"Fast careful,\" she said. \"And if that's impossible, just fast.\" She glanced at Caelin's arm. \"Beacon-boy, if you could stop being a lighthouse—\"\n\n\"Working on it,\" he said, and because the truth cost less than a lie, added, \"I can't.\"\n\nThornik had grandfather's journal spread on the black table, brass goggles riding his brow, big fingers unshakably precise. His beard smelled faintly of beeswax oil and iron dust. \"Forge Road's our best way out—old ore route, still marked sound when Grandfather walked it. Six hours if stone loves us, twelve if it doesn't.\"\n\nElowen sat cross-legged near the Abjuration alcove where her vine-ink picked up a little of the ward-light, emerald threaded with silver-gold. She lay her palm to the floor and winced—stone fever, pressure, the fabric of the place pulled too tight. \"This chamber holds for now,\" she said. \"Everything tied to the sanctum's bones is failing. Whatever hunts us is... patient. Learning the ward geometry.\"\n\nA smear of darkness slid under the rune-line at her feet—a thin filament of shadow testing the gap between two chiselled glyphs. The ward flared white-hot. For one knife-bright instant the shadow became a living silhouette of its owner's hand—tendons, knuckles, too many joints—then ignited. It fled screaming without a sound, scuttling back as a scatter of ash that ran like insects, burned to nothing before it reached the dark.\n\nNo one breathed.\n\n\"They're clever,\" Nyxara said softly from the Necromancy alcove, as if admiring a well-played move in someone else's game. Her purple eyes tracked the ward seam a beat longer. \"Not clever enough.\"\n\nOn the edge of the chamber Durgan stood with his back to stone, eyes pale and unblinking. His shadow lay neat at his boots. It twitched once toward the ward-line when the burned ash fled, and he crushed it flat until his jaw clicked.\n\nThe pressure of holding it down built behind his eyes like fingers pressing into his temples. When he finally released his concentration, a thin warmth trickled from his left nostril. He wiped it with the back of his hand—checking, confirming. The skin came away with a single red smear.\n\nFirst blood, he thought, and tucked his hand away before anyone could see. How many more before I can't stop it anymore?\n\n“Move before they learn a new trick,” Serana said. She pushed to her feet and didn’t look back to check the wards. They held or they didn’t. Either way, the only answer was forward.\n\nVex rolled a shoulder, felt the pull of healing ribs beneath. \"Define intact.\"\n\n\"Alive,\" Serana said. \"Everything else is optional.\"\n\nThornik snapped the journal shut and slung on his pack. \"Forge Road starts through the transmutation arch. Watch your steps. The mountain is currently... structurally questionable but functional.\"\n\n\"That phrase has never comforted me,\" Vex said.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to,\" Thornik replied cheerfully. \"It's supposed to be true.\"\n\nThey packed to travel-light: water, rope, wedges and braces for Thornik, rations like stone, no spare comforts. The ward-line pulsed off-beat once, a tired strobe. The bass in the room thickened.\n\nThud.\n\n\"Go,\" Serana said.\n\nThey went.",

                "text": "ACT II: THE GAUNTLET\n\nForge Road fell away steeply, steps cut straight into living rock by hands that valued efficiency. The air turned wet and metallic; the tunnel smelled of wet granite, old slag, and the copper tang of slow rust. Thornik's lantern burned low, the flame cupped, throwing a disciplined cone of light.\n\nHe read the stone as he walked—hairline fractures, load paths, the cross-rib where an ancient brace took more weight than it should. He laid spring-steel wedges into seams with a quiet click, braces kissing the stone to buy them minutes later when seconds might matter. \"Don't touch the walls,\" he said. \"They're listening.\"\n\nThe sound from below grew clearer as the wards' dampening effect faded with distance. No longer muffled. Present. Rhythmic.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nAn hour in, the mountain shivered. Dust fell in silky threads. Everyone stopped on instinct, breath held until the tremor passed.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Serana said, and they did.\n\nThey came to a collapse—a doorway half-buried by a spill of dwarf-cut granite. Thornik knelt. \"Option one: explosive. Brings the ceiling to visit. Option two: levers. Time we don't have.\"\n\nCaelin stepped beside him, put his right hand on the keystone, and called the smallest heat he could bear—a focused candle on a pinhead, nothing grand. The scale warmed; the ache sharpened like a pulled muscle. Granite ticked and softened to a bead of glass the crowbar could bite.\n\nThornik levered. Stone slid. Passage opened.\n\nCaelin pulled back, breath hissing. The filaments flared angry red, then settled back to baseline coal-glow. He didn't count what he had left. He didn't know. He only knew there was still enough to hurt and not enough to be careless.\n\n\"You know,\" Nyxara said as she followed him through, \"most men would have tried a bonfire to impress me.\"\n\n\"I'm rationing,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Tragic. I had a speech about stamina prepared.\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"Save it for someone persuadable.\"\n\nA narrow twitch at the corner of her mouth—caught between miffed and entertained. \"You're going to be the end of me, Ember-boy.\"\n\n\"Get in line,\" Vex called from the far side, one hand pressed to her ribs as if checking they still held. \"We're all waiting our turn.\"\n\nThe mountain answered with a deeper thud that rattled loose grit down Caelin's neck.\n\nThey moved on.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nA long corridor followed—clean, quiet, no falls, no scrapes—only the heartbeat below growing clearer as the wards' bass-trap effect faded with distance. The sound no longer felt distant. It felt present—not beneath them specifically, but everywhere at once, resonating through the mountain like a heartbeat felt through pressed palms.\n\nIn the hush, a shadow-dart whispered along the floor ahead of them, a hair-thin ribbon sliding fast. It struck an old dwarven inlay they barely saw—a sliver of ward rune hidden in decorative filigree—and the floor line erupted in a curtain of sheet-fire two hands high. The dart became a coil of screaming soot-snakes that fled backward into the dark.\n\n\"Good,\" Vex murmured. \"Let it keep proving we shouldn't turn around.\"\n\nTwo hours in, they crawled through a chamber where the ceiling had molted down blocks the size of coffins. \"Fast careful,\" Thornik said. \"Step where I step. Don't even breathe loudly.\"\n\nVex's boot knocked a small stone. It skittered. A support block shifted a fraction, and the chamber groaned like a sleeping giant turning over. They sprinted the last ten feet in a pelting rain of grit and pea-stone. Not a full collapse. A reminder.\n\nBehind them, the pursuit-scrapes paused. Listening. Counting. Herding.\n\n\"They want us deeper,\" Durgan said without looking back. His voice was flat, factual.\n\n\"Then we go deeper on our terms,\" Serana answered.\n\nThree hours in, Elowen stopped with her hand to the wall. The rootwork in her arms brightened; a single vine-filament along her wrist blackened another shade, flaking an ash petal onto the floor. \"The Weave is screaming ahead. A major brace near a junction is under more stress than it can carry. If it goes while we're under it—\"\n\n\"How long?\" Serana asked.\n\n\"Minutes. Hours. Or it started while I was speaking.\"\n\n\"Faster,\" Vex said, and winced as her ribs protested the thought.\n\nThey went faster.\n\nFour hours in, another choke point. Thornik measured. Levers would work—eventually. Explosives would kill them. Caelin set his palm to a stone and gave it heat like a match-head. Glass bloomed under his hand; Thornik heaved; the way opened.\n\nPain threaded Caelin's lattice, not a scream, a serrated sigh. The scale pulsed angry red for three heartbeats, then faded back to coal-glow. Manageable, for now.\n\nNyxara fell in beside him again, voice a ribbon of dark amusement. \"Refreshing, this restraint. I've been tracking something hot all morning, but I suppose I can exercise patience.\"\n\n\"Tracking the path,\" Caelin said.\n\nHer eyes glinted. \"Among other things.\"\n\n\"Save those speeches too,\" he said, and kept moving.\n\nA laugh. Low. Honest. Then the heartbeat underfoot stole the humor back.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nFive hours in, Serana held a thin, mobile ward over them to shed small falls and carry the sound of their feet away. It flickered once, a brief stutter that she forced flat. She didn't meet anyone's eyes.\n\n\"Define 'fine,'\" Vex said.\n\n\"Not dying,\" Serana said.\n\n\"Optional,\" Vex muttered.\n\nThornik's breath rasped under his cheer. \"We're close to the junction chambers,\" he said. \"Three-way split: mines, smelters, caldera to surface. The caldera stair is our goal.\"\n\n\"Unless the mountain disagrees,\" Vex said.\n\n\"Stone always gets a vote,\" Thornik said. \"Today I'm asking it nicely.\"\n\nSix hours in, the tunnel widened without warning.\n\nThey swung into a vast chamber where the walls curved like the inside of a bell.\n\nBridges of black iron spanned the emptiness—hundreds of them—some whole, some snapped mid-arch and hanging by cables older than language. Below, molten seams traced geometric rivers through the dark, glowing like veins under translucent skin.\n\nThornik's breath fogged his goggles. \"This isn't natural construction. It's metallurgy on a planetary scale.\"\n\nNyxara's voice echoed softly: \"Or worship with better tools.\"\n\nThe Chamber of Echoes.\n\nSerana held her torch close to inscriptions along the nearest bridge rail—spiral glyphs carved deep and inlaid with gold now blackened by heat. Caelin brushed one with his gloved fingers. It thrummed faintly under the touch, familiar in the way of fever dreams.\n\n\"Same pattern as the Seal,\" he said.\n\nThornik nodded. \"Then we're standing in its bloodstream.\"\n\nVex looked down into the molten rivers far below. \"Let's try not to puncture anything vital.\"\n\nThe hum shifted mid-sentence—Thornik's last word echoed a heartbeat later, repeated perfectly but stretched thin, like parchment under strain.\n\nThen Caelin's breath followed, an exhale caught and replayed back to him, slightly off-tempo.\n\nThey all stopped.\n\nSerana whispered, \"Echo.\"\n\nBut the word came back not once, not twice, but in every voice in the group—each one slightly wrong. Serana, Vex, Nyxara, Caelin, Thornik, Durgan, Elowen—all overlapping, all whispering echo in a chorus that didn't belong to any of them.\n\nThe sound faded like a tide withdrawing.\n\nNo one spoke for a full minute after.\n\nThey moved quickly across one of the intact bridges, giving the central darkness wide berth. The air here tasted of coin and ozone. Light from their torches bled into the rock instead of reflecting, as if the stone drank it.\n\nHalfway across, Elowen tilted her head. \"Do you hear them?\"\n\nSerana frowned. \"Just echoes.\"\n\n\"No,\" Elowen said. \"They're trying to remember what they were saying.\"\n\nThe air quivered. A dozen faint voices whispered over one another, too faint to catch—then aligned, forming a single phrase in Draconic that Caelin understood without translation.\n\n\"Hold the flame. Guard the law. Bury the cost.\"\n\nThe same three lines, repeating in different cadences, layered until they blurred into music.\n\nThe scale in his arm began to glow faintly through his sleeve—a bright warm pulse of recognition.\n\n\"I've heard this before,\" he said.\n\nSerana's face tightened. \"Prophecy?\"\n\n\"Command,\" Caelin whispered. \"But it doesn't know who to give it to.\"\n\nThornik produced a tuning rod from his pack—a spare, cruder than the one the mountain had shattered two days ago, but it would serve—ignoring Vex’s muttered warning. “If it’s an acoustic record, we can pull more data.”\n\nHe struck the rod lightly against stone.\n\nThe resulting tone spiraled outward, repeating itself, climbing octaves until the air vibrated visibly. The chamber answered.\n\nA column of sound formed in the air—dense enough to distort the light—and within it flickered outlines of figures at work: massive shapes, part dragon, part machine, hammering something that shone like molten sunrise.\n\nThen the image stuttered and bled away, leaving silence so heavy it felt deliberate.\n\nA fine mist of dust fell from the ceiling, glowing faintly.\n\nElowen looked up in alarm. \"Stop. It's—\"\n\nToo late. The sound collapsed inward, a sonic implosion that slammed everyone to their knees. Ears rang. Torches snuffed.\n\nWhen Caelin's vision cleared, Thornik was bleeding from the nose, staring dazed at his shattered rod.\n\n\"Note,\" he croaked. \"Don't do that again.\"\n\nVex kicked the broken metal off the platform, grimacing at the pull in her ribs. \"Brilliant deduction.\"\n\nNyxara stood very still, eyes half-lidded as if listening inward. \"They aren't ghosts,\" she said finally. \"They're instructions. The mountain replays them when something familiar enters the system. We woke the archive.\"\n\nSerana drew a slow breath. \"An archive of what?\"\n\nNyxara met her gaze. \"Every order the gods ever gave their creations. Every one that failed.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—then again, brighter. The heat licked up Caelin's arm, across his collarbone, behind his eyes. Voices flooded in—thousands, layered, overlapping. Command structures, prayers, screams of obedience and defiance all at once.\n\nFor a second, he saw through their memories: dragons kneeling to unseen figures, humans bound by glowing chains, cities forged then unmade by song.\n\nHe staggered, gripping the nearest railing.\n\nElowen's hand found his shoulder. \"Stay here,\" she said fiercely. \"Stay present.\"\n\nHe breathed through it, the images fading like cooling iron.\n\nSerana caught his other arm, voice sharp. \"Caelin!\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he lied. The scale flickered white-hot for an instant—lie detected—then settled back.\n\nThornik, pale but upright, whispered, \"It recognized him. The system thinks he's one of them.\"\n\n\"Then we move,\" Vex said. \"Before it decides to collect.\"\n\nThey crossed the chamber quickly, their footsteps echoing in unnatural sync. Each time the echoes came back, they were half a beat too slow—as if something behind them was learning to walk.\n\nNear the far archway, the air shimmered. At first it was just heat distortion from below. Then it wasn't.\n\nA voice said, \"Caelin.\"\n\nHe froze. The sound came from behind—his own tone, precise down to the hesitation between syllables.\n\nEveryone turned. The path behind them was empty.\n\n\"Not funny,\" Vex said automatically, though no one had spoken.\n\n\"I didn't—\" Caelin began, but stopped. His throat had gone dry.\n\nThe voice came again, softer. \"Caelin. Follow.\"\n\nThornik muttered a formula under his breath, trying to anchor the acoustics. \"Reflected sound... but there's no source.\"\n\nNyxara's smile was faint. \"Oh, there's a source. It just borrowed your mouth to speak.\"\n\nThe echo shifted targets.\n\n\"Elowen.\"\n\nHer own name, spoken like a sigh through leaves.\n\nShe staggered. \"The forest uses names for roots. This isn't the forest.\"\n\nSerana stepped forward. \"Stop listening.\"\n\n\"That's not how ears work,\" Vex snapped, hand moving to a dagger hilt.\n\nThen it spoke again—Serana's voice this time, steady and cold. \"Faith bends. It doesn't always break.\"\n\nSerana's jaw clenched. \"That's what I said last night.\"\n\n\"It remembers,\" Nyxara said. \"It's collecting words that meant something.\"\n\nThornik, because curiosity survived even terror, called softly into the dark. \"Thornik.\"\n\nNothing.\n\nHe exhaled, relieved—then heard it whispered back three times in a child's voice, each repetition younger than the last.\n\nHe stumbled back hard enough to knock his goggles askew. \"Never again,\" he muttered. \"Never—again.\"\n\nThe air trembled, repeating the words in exact cadence: \"Never again.\"\n\nThen quieter: \"Never.\"\n\nLight warped with the next pulse of the hum. The walls sweated condensation that smelled of iron and oil. Their torches flared green, then white. The flame stretched sideways, casting shadows that now mouthed along with the voices.\n\nSerana tried to summon her wardlight. The sigil formed, flickered, and folded in on itself until only a faint circle of ash remained.\n\n\"I can't hold it,\" she whispered. \"Even faith has an echo.\"\n\nDurgan drew his axe, slow and steady. \"Forward. Always forward.\"\n\n\"Why not back?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Because back isn't there anymore,\" he said, and pointed.\n\nThe corridor behind them had sealed—not collapsed, but simply wasn't, replaced by seamless metal still warm to the touch.\n\nThornik stared. \"Topography editing. It's rewriting as we move.\"\n\n\"Then we move fast,\" Caelin said.\n\nThe scale pulsed once toward the left passage—hot, insistent. Not the black-violet of corruption, but the bright warm pulse of recognition. Caelin didn’t wait for a vote.\n\n“Left,” he said, and moved.\n\n“Trusting the thing that just tried to eat us?” Vex asked, falling in behind him.\n\n“It’s not trust,” he said. “It’s recognition.”\n\nAs they walked, the walls began to whisper fragments of old conversations: Vex mocking Thornik's kettle, Serana's muttered prayers, Elowen's earlier warning about warmth.\n\nThe mountain had been listening since Thornwick. Now it was talking back.\n\nElowen's hand brushed Caelin's arm. \"The flame mark answers to more than one master,\" she said.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied. \"I just don't know which is winning.\"\n\nThe corridor opened into another chamber—a narrow nave lined with glass coffers filled with ash. Light flickered inside each like dying hearts.\n\nThen his own voice came from the darkness ahead: \"I called the fire. I killed her to save you.\"\n\nEvery muscle in Caelin's body locked.\n\nThat sentence didn't exist outside his memory. No one else had ever heard it.\n\nSerana stepped closer, sword half drawn. \"Who said that?\"\n\nCaelin swallowed. \"I did. Once.\"\n\nThe echo stepped forward—his height, his face, his wound still glowing faintly through translucent skin.\n\nIt smiled. \"Still burning,\" it said.\n\nHe backed away. The others followed his lead, weapons ready but useless against something made of memory.\n\nThe echo tilted its head, movements just slightly off-beat, as if learning how joints worked.\n\nWhen it spoke again, it used all their voices together.\n\n\"We are the Seal.\"\n\nThe hum surged; dust fell in bright spirals. The glass coffers flared, each releasing a puff of ash that drifted like breath.\n\nCaelin reached for fire, stopped himself, forced the heat inward until it was pain and not power. The scale burned angry red under his skin but he held it, contained it.\n\nThe mimic paused—as if confused by restraint—and in that instant Serana hurled her dagger through its chest.\n\nThe blade passed through light and hit the wall behind with a sharp, clean clink.\n\nThe echo shattered into sound—hundreds of overlapping syllables that faded into silence.\n\nWhen hearing returned, Vex said softly, \"Next time, we burn it first.\"\n\n\"No,\" Caelin said. \"We learn why it knows my name.\"\n\nThey left the chamber in silence, the scale in Caelin's arm fading from red back to baseline coal-glow.\n\nBehind them, the shards of light pulled together, reforming a faint outline.\n\nIt whispered after them in Caelin's voice, calm and sure: \"Still burning.\"\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nThey reached the far archway and the space opened like a cathedral of living rock. Three vaulted passages split at precise angles; ribs of stone arced floor to ceiling in calculated load-bearing perfection.\n\nThornik consulted his journal one last time, marked a route with charcoal. \"Junction chambers. The caldera route is our way out.\"\n\nBut the ribs were cracking. Visible stress fractures spider-webbing across supports that had held for millennia. Dust sifted in steady streams. The air smelled of ozone and pulverized granite.\n\nAnd the sound—\n\nThud.\n\nDeep. Resonant. Felt through boot-soles more than heard.\n\nThud. Thud.\n\nThe Seal's heartbeat. Not from one direction. From everywhere. The mountain itself had become its chamber.\n\n\"Everyone move,\" Thornik said, voice tight. \"This entire structure is about to—\"\n\nThe mountain shook.",

                "text": "ACT III: THE COLLAPSE\n\nThe junction chamber came apart in stages.\n\nFirst: the leftmost rib sheared. Not slowly. Not with warning. Just—SNAP—and tons of stone cascaded from the vault in wagon-sized blocks.\n\n\"LEFT SIDE!\" Vex shouted as they scrambled right and the floor where they'd been standing vanished under rubble.\n\nThe mountain's rhythm broke into a riot: THUD--thud--THUD—thud--THUD, a crowd of heartbeats not their own. Caelin's pulse tried to follow and stumbled; a sick skip behind his sternum knocked his balance half a step off. Dust hissed from the ribs like breath through teeth. The air carried the wet-clay breath of new fractures and a metal tang, and static prickled along their forearms.\n\nThe scale in Caelin's arm blazed black-violet at the edges—full corruption bloom, the Seal's influence flooding the chamber like invisible tide. Not close. Not here. But present. Aware. The obsidian plate pulsed irregular, excited: thud-THUD-thud-THUD.\n\nIt wants me, he understood. The Seal. It can FEEL the Ember. And it's using whatever power it has to collapse the mountain, to drop me closer to it.\n\nSecond: the right-hand arch—their intended exit—let go like a builder's curse fulfilled. The pre-stressed keystone clicked, a clean crack ran the span, and the arch folded inward in a slate-gray avalanche that sealed the passage throat to floor.\n\nShadows slid ahead of the collapse—thin whips testing the raw edge where ward-glyphs didn't quite reach. Caelin's scale flared red-gold; its halo seared those probes to curling soot that skittered away like burned spiders.\n\nThird: the floor cracked. A black lightning zigzag split the chamber from waist to wall and widened with every breath. The Seal's poly-rhythm devolved into pure thrill—THUD-thud-THUD-thud-THUD—no pattern, just a chained thing thrashing in joy at the scent of fire.\n\nELOWEN was at the rear—counting heads, keeping stragglers from becoming ghosts—when the slab under her boots lowered, wrong as a breath drawn by stone. She saw Durgan sprint clear; Nyxara took the widening cut in one clean leap; Caelin turned back toward her—\n\nNot enough time.\n\nShe chose.\n\nShe slammed her staff and called the new magic: not growth, load-sharing. Roots erupted from living wood, racing across the failing geometry in a glowing web—but these weren't the sickly pale green of dying nature-magic. They blazed emerald shot through with threads of silver-gold, the Abjuration influence from the Deep Hall now woven into her very being.\n\nThe roots didn't brace the mountain; they borrowed weight—took the load for three breaths, then two, then one—as the transformed power coursed through her tattoos until the channels screamed. The smell of burning green knifed through dust—sharp chlorophyll-sweet, life paying itself out, but underneath it the metallic tang of ward-magic being consumed.\n\nThe web held. The lowering paused.\n\n\"GO!\" Her voice cut the riot clean. \"I can't hold—MOVE!\"\n\nSerana’s hand went up—chalk sigil, instinct, geometry she still believed in—and the ward simply wasn’t there. The mountain swallowed the shape before it formed. She chose the only thing left: she hooked Caelin’s harness with both hands and dragged him back before the slab surged. She chose too: one lost or many. Not a prayer. Just arithmetic.\n\nHe wrenched to go anyway. The floor lurched.\n\nElowen's tattoos burned from emerald-and-silver to pure white. The root-web flared to ash, spent—not shattered, not explosive, simply gone. The transformation magic that had given her new purpose consumed itself in one final act of protection.\n\nThe slab dropped. She went with it, swallowed in a grinding maw of stone. No cry. No light—neither green nor gold. No staff—wood splintered as the last charge emptied.\n\nDust boiled and sealed the black mouth into a gray scar.\n\nAbove, the riot in the rock pitched higher, delighted. Caelin lunged for the edge—\n\n\"MOVE OR—\" Nyxara started, a warning that became prophecy as their section lowered under their boots.\n\nThey fell.\n\nOne heartbeat: solid stone. The next: nothing. Caelin tumbled through choking dust, the world a roll of jagged edges and red sparks. Instinct screamed heat the air—stupid instinct. Hot wind doesn't hold weight. He tucked, took the rock on shoulder and thigh, let pain be ballast. A debris slope caught him—cruel, angled, still better than a pit—and he shed momentum in skin and blood.\n\nParallel on the slide, Nyxara fell with the eerie grace of someone who'd made a career out of surviving bad ideas. Pact-power whispered—no force, no shove—simply convinced the falling stones she wasn't part of the story. Angles and experience did the rest. She surfed the avalanche to a jutting ledge and cut speed in a low, bruising crouch.\n\nThey hit. Caelin sprawled, gasping; his right arm lit in a lattice of red pain as the scale jarred against bone. The filaments flared angry red, screaming, then slowly faded back toward coal-glow.\n\nAbove, stone sealed on stone.\n\n\"CAELIN!\" Serana's voice knifed through muffling tons. \"CAN YOU HEAR ME?\"\n\nHe coughed grit. \"ALIVE! WE'RE ALIVE!\"\n\n\"CAN'T REACH YOU! ROUTE'S SEALED!\"\n\n\"WE'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY!\"\n\n\"SURFACE EXIT—EAST FACE—WE'LL WAIT!\" Thin as thread, then gone. Either distance, or the mountain decided they'd said enough.\n\nCaelin sat, cataloguing damage: bruises blooming, shoulder shrieking, the lattice aching but holding. He hadn't cast. Could have. Wanted to. Didn't. Small victory.\n\nNyxara tested joints—grimace, then a shrug. \"Sprained. Mobile. Ten out of ten would not recommend.\"\n\nHe stood, staggered, found purpose. \"Mark the wall. Let them know.\"\n\nHe burned Draconic into a clean slab with a tight ember thread: ALIVE. FOLLOWING HEAT. FIND US SURFACE EAST.\n\nBeneath it, he added Thornik's party sigil—three short strokes, one long. So the others would know it was them.\n\nThe scale's glow dimmed from ember-red back to soft coal as the magic settled.\n\nSomewhere beyond the sealed chokes and ruined ribs, the noise shifted. The riot dropped back to patience; the world's pressure exhaled.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nNot below, not above—everywhere. Presence, not location. Influence bleeding through leagues of stone.\n\n\"Time to move,\" Nyxara said, already limping toward the only path that wasn't trying to kill them yet. \"Before the mountain changes its mind. Or the pets find a new seam.\"\n\nHe stood there a moment longer than the task required.\n\nHe kept thinking of small things. The way she’d pressed two fingers to stone and said it listens back. The first time she eased the lattice-burn and he’d been too surprised to say thank you. The vine-marks on her wrists the morning they left the Deep Hall—two more blackened, and she hadn’t mentioned it, just kept walking. He hadn’t mentioned it either. He’d thought there was time.\n\nThat was the part that would stay with him. Not the sound of the slab. The assumption of time.\n\nCaelin looked once at the sealed scar. No token. No miracle. The stone didn’t care, and he said it anyway: “I’m sorry.”\n\nThe scale warmed—acknowledgment, not comfort.\n\nHe put her name away in the place where you put things you can’t carry and can’t put down. Then he turned into the dark.\n\n\n\nUp in the junction they'd abandoned, dust settled where green-and-gold light had been. No voice. No staff. No trace.\n\nThe mountain's riot eased back to patient counting, as if the chain below had tested the links and found them holding—for now.\n\nDurgan stood at the edge of the sealed passage, ice-blue eyes tracking the crack where Caelin had disappeared. His shadow had leapt for that crack like a starving animal smelling meat—reaching, stretching ten feet across rubble before he crushed it flat with will and pain.\n\nThe pressure burst something. Blood ran from both nostrils now, not a trickle but a stream. He wiped it with the back of his hand, stared at the red smear, then tucked his hand away.\n\nFaster, he thought. It's happening faster.\n\nNo one had seen. They were too busy staring at where their companions had fallen.\n\n“We move,” Serana said, voice hollow but functional. “Find another route. Reach the surface. Meet them at the east exit.”\n\nShe didn’t say if they’re alive. The silence did it for her.\n\nThornik unrolled his journal with shaking hands. “Vent shaft route. Steep. Narrow. But it reaches surface.” He marked it with charcoal, the line wavering. “Two hours. Maybe three.”\n\n“Then we climb,” Vex said. Her voice was flat, empty of its usual edge. She pressed a hand to her ribs, felt them creak, and kept it there. She turned to move—and caught the tail end of Durgan tucking his hand into his sleeve. Not fast enough. The wrong colour on his upper lip.\n\nShe held the look for one breath. Filed it. Said nothing. Elowen was gone and Caelin was somewhere below and her ribs were broken and there was only so much room.\n\nThey turned toward the vent shaft entrance—a crack in the chamber wall barely wide enough for shoulders.\n\nBehind them, the Seal counted.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nPatient. Waiting.",

In the dark, distance turned elastic, measured only by the steady coal-glow of Caelin's scale and the pricked red points far below.\n\nHe counted steps so he wouldn’t count losses. One breath. One more. Again.\n\nThe scale sat at coal-glow—baseline, steady, indifferent to grief. He focused on that. On the temperature of the stone under his boots, the pull of the debris slope, the small calculations of footing. He was good at small calculations. He had been making them since Thornwick and they had kept him useful and upright and he was going to keep making them now, in this tunnel, in this dark, until the habit of surviving outlasted the habit of feeling.\n\nIt wasn’t working especially well.\n\nNyxara moved beside him with careful economy despite the twist in her ankle, saying nothing for long stretches, then: \"You're quiet. Brooding, or rationing air?\"\n\n\"Thinking,\" he said.\n\n\"About the druid who bought us time.\" No softness to it. Just truth.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"She chose,\" Nyxara said. \"You honor it by surviving, not by drowning in guilt.\" A beat. \"And by keeping that thing in your arm from getting us both killed.\"\n\nThey dropped onto a broader landing. Caelin paused, burned a quick line on the wall: ALIVE → and beneath it the simple four-stroke sigil Thornik had taught them—three short, one long.\n\nThe scale's glow brightened briefly as he worked, then settled back to baseline coal.\n\nThey moved again. The air warmed by degrees until the tunnel opened like a throat into a chamber so vast it made their footfalls feel impertinent.\n\nThe Forge Caldera wasn't a room; it was a memory made of stone.\n\nTiered galleries ringed a polished obsidian floor. Dozens of cold hearths stood in concentric circles around a central pit, their banks still faintly embered as if the world had simply forgotten to finish cooling. The place smelled of quenched steel and old oil; somewhere in the rock a thin, impossible ringing went on, like the last note of a hammer that never quite died.\n\nCaelin's Ember answered with a low pulse; his scale brightened from coal to ember-red—not warning, but recognition. Bright warm pulse of resonance.\n\n\"This is where they forged the Concord,\" Nyxara murmured, actual awe loosening her voice.\n\nCaelin nodded, chest tight. Heritage felt like grief when it came late.\n\nAcross the caldera, a bridge arched over the central pit—elegant, dwarven, impossible. Beyond it, stairs spiraled toward a pale wash of daylight.\n\n\"Route's there,\" he said. \"We skirt the pit.\"\n\nThey set out along the perimeter, keeping the corrupted glow at center-left and plenty of stone between. It wasn't the black-violet ache of the Seal; it was old taint, a bruise that never healed.\n\nHalfway around, Nyxara's footing went soft on a talus spill and she started to slide. She caught herself on a carved rail, hissed at the jolt, then whispered something that wasn't words so much as suggestion. Her pact-whisper slid across the debris—not force but permission—and the fall obliged, choosing other paths. She righted, breath steadying.\n\nAround them, the scale showed a brief silver shimmer—proximity to active magic—then faded back.\n\n\"Efficient,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Persuasive,\" she corrected, amused. \"My specialty.\"\n\nThey reached the bridge. On the rail, half-buried in dust, lay a fractured tool: a joint-mark chisel with dwarvish geometry on one cheek and a draconic maker-sigil on the other—a language of edges and fire.\n\nCaelin picked it up, wiped grime with his sleeve, and tucked it into his pack. \"Proof,\" he said, thinking of Thornik. \"For the councils who don't believe.\"\n\nOn the near abutment, he burned the party sigil and a neat ↗ EAST arrow into the stone. \"In case they come this way,\" he said.\n\nNyxara limped onto the span, then paused to breathe. \"Not to be indelicate,\" she said, tone going bright with mischief, \"but we're alone, nearly died, and you still haven't tried to hold my hand for courage. Should I be insulted?\"\n\n\"Flirting seems inefficient,\" Caelin said, and meant it.\n\nShe laughed—genuine, quick. \"Impossible to embarrass. Refreshing.\" She patted his shoulder, friendly, not coy. \"I'll keep trying anyway. Everyone breaks eventually.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to.\"\n\n\"That's what makes it interesting.\"\n\nThey crossed without looking down. The staircase beyond breathed knife-cold air flecked with the mineral tang of altitude. Daylight brightened from rumor to promise.\n\nThey climbed, and the caldera's endless ringing faded behind them like a heartbeat choosing to be memory.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nDistant. Patient. Still counting.\n\nAt the final landing, a door waited—dwarf-carved, sealed by ice grown old enough to be stubborn. Caelin set two fingers of heat to the latch: just enough to soften, not enough to cost. The mechanism sighed; the slab rolled aside.\n\nThe scale pulsed angry red briefly—small magic, small cost—then settled back.\n\nDaylight. Sky. A ledge chiseled into the mountain's east face.\n\nThe air was knife-cold and clean, spiced with sun-warmed lichen and far pine-smoke dragged upslope by a contrary breeze.\n\nNyxara closed her eyes and stood in it like a priest. \"Surface,\" she said. \"I had a bet with myself.\"\n\n\"You win?\"\n\n\"I always do.\"\n\nThey didn't linger. Caelin oriented—sun angle, ridge line, memory of shouted directions through stone. \"Forge Road exit should be two hours along this band.\"\n\n\"Then let's not give the mountain time to change its mind,\" Nyxara said, and they set off along the ledge, the Emberpeaks glowering polite and ancient behind them.",

                "text": "ACT V: ABOVE — THE VENT SHAFT ROUTE (Serana, Vex, Thornik, Durgan)\n\nThe vent shaft was a stone throat that refused to swallow.\n\nThornik went first, shoulders scraping both walls, muttering cheerfully obscene things at geology. Vex slid after him sideways, breath clipped to keep her ribs from complaining out loud. Serana followed, armor ghosting sparks from old rock. Durgan brought up the rear, dragging nothing but a long, obedient shadow.\n\nGrit rained in fits. Serana laced a paper-thin ward over their faces—muscle memory, not miracle—and it skinned the dust from their eyes when the shaft shed a handful of centuries. The light was hers—steady gold from trained discipline, not divine gift—and it held.\n\n\"Remind me,\" Thornik grunted, wedging through a pinch, \"why I volunteered the route most likely to make me a cork.\"\n\n\"Because the alternative involved dying beautifully underground,\" Vex said. She tried a small breath; her ribs sparked protest. She hid the wince behind a scowl. \"You also said, and I quote, 'Left shaft has the coldest air—surface that way.'\"\n\n\"Present-Thornik applauds Past-Thornik's olfactory heroism,\" he said, pleased despite himself.\n\nThey squeezed into a run of broader tunnel, air colder, cleaner. Frost rimed old soot on the stone. Above them: a ribbon of blue like a promise.\n\nSerana climbed on discipline more than faith. Her goddess had been a static-laced channel for days; the old prayers returned as faint as wishful thinking. Fine. Duty would do. Duty and the ward under her skin, thin as paper and twice as stubborn.\n\nBehind, Durgan stopped once, hand braced to the wall. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand—checking, confirming—but the skin came away clean.\n\nNot yet, he thought. But soon.\n\nHe could feel it building. The intervals between shadow-tests were shortening. What had been hours was now minutes. He dug his nails into his palm until pain returned his hands to him, then climbed on.\n\nAt a three-way split, Thornik sniffed the drafts, checked his grandfather's blood-spattered diagram, and pointed left. \"Coldest. And it tastes like snow,\" he said, delighted.\n\n\"Your nose is a menace,\" Vex said, grimacing as she tried to keep pace. The ribs pulled with every breath.\n\n\"It's also getting us out,\" Thornik said, gentler than the banter wanted to be.\n\nThey climbed another hour, then the shaft widened to a slot of white.\n\nThe foursome spilled onto a ledge scraped by old avalanches, the world dropping away in a dignified hurry.\n\nSky. Actual, indifferent sky.\n\nThornik shaded his eyes, traced the east face. \"There—half-hidden by scree. The primary Forge Road exit. If they made it through the forges, they'll come out there.\"\n\n\"How far?\" Serana asked.\n\n\"Two hours along the band. Maybe less if the goats have been generous.\"\n\n\"Then we move,\" Serana said. She looked once at the mountain, where the wind carved the ridges into saints and knives, and whispered the two words she hadn't let herself say aloud: \"For Elowen.\"\n\nVex's hand found her dagger hilt, white-knuckled. She said nothing. Didn't need to.\n\nThey started the traverse, Durgan last, shadow flat and patient at his heels.",

Nyxara kept to his left—habit now, where the drop yawned wider—and made a show of not leaning on him.\n\n\"Almost there,\" she said. \"See? No dramatic rescues required. Very dull.\"\n\n\"Would've helped if you'd fallen,\" he said, then realized how it sounded. \"To get it over with.\" He grimaced. \"That was poorly phrased.\"\n\n\"Adorable,\" she said, delighted. \"Points for honesty.\"\n\nThey rounded a buttress; the ledge widened.\n\nAbove: Thornik and Vex took first watch positions overlooking the cave mouth. The air bit their teeth; the lichen patches on sun-facing rock bled a pleasant, warm smell that didn't belong to cold places.\n\n\"They're late,\" Vex said, hand pressed to her ribs.\n\n\"They're alive,\" Thornik countered, because you had to choose which truth to feed.\n\nBelow: A glint of metal ahead—a buckle on a pack strap—then the shape wearing it resolved into Thornik, broader than the mountain remembered.\n\nCaelin lifted a hand.\n\nAbove: \"Movement,\" Thornik said, and Vex was already rising, jaw tight as the ribs reminded her she was made of meat and stubbornness.\n\nSerana stood slower, as if unwilling to jinx it, and Durgan's eyes found a coal-glow he'd been both dreading and needing.\n\nBelow: Nyxara waved like they'd come across friends at a festival. \"Well. How convenient.\"\n\nAbove: \"They're alive,\" Serana said, and didn't smile so much as allow the expression to happen to her face.\n\n\n\nThey met on a rubble-shelf wide enough for six people and too small for grief.\n\nSerana's gauntleted hand settled on Caelin's shoulder—not a hug, just proof. \"You made it.\"\n\n\"So did you,\" he said.\n\nThornik checked them both with brisk, professional hands, then blinked when Caelin handed him the fractured chisel. He turned it over, breath catching at the twin maker's marks—dwarf and dragon, working as one.\n\n\"By the old forges,\" he whispered. \"This... this is going to shut some very loud people up.\"\n\n\"Use it well,\" Caelin said.\n\nVex hung back a half step, letting relief show only in how her knives went away without being asked. She straightened too fast; pain shot through her ribs. She swallowed the sound. Thornik noticed anyway and shifted his pack off his right shoulder so she wouldn't have to take the wind on her bad side.\n\nNyxara's eyes moved across faces, counting. \"Not everyone,\" she said, soft for her.\n\nNo one answered. The mountain had already said it.\n\nFrom the stone's long throat, distant and patient and impossible to place: thud. Thud. Thud. The Seal's count resumed, indifferent to daylight.\n\nSerana let the moment last exactly as long as it could bear and not a blink more. \"We move. Millbrook is three days. Rest, resupply, information. Then we plan.\"\n\n\"What do we plan?\" Thornik asked, though he knew.\n\n\"To finish what we started,\" she said. \"To make it mean something.\"\n\nThey turned down-slope, six where there had been seven, the east wind combing the cliff grass into silver.\n\nHalf a switchback below, Vex paused, head canted to the wind. \"Don't look now,\" she said lightly, \"but we have admirers.\"\n\nThornik followed her line. Far down the face, where the scree ran like a river, a single figure crested a rib of stone.\n\nToo still. Too patient. Even at distance, something about its silhouette felt WRONG—the way it held itself, the way it didn't shift weight like living things do.\n\nIt watched.\n\nThen it stepped backward—not turning, just REVERSING—and was gone.\n\n\"Scouts,\" Serana said, voice flat. Not afraid. Accounting.\n\n\"Distant,\" Vex confirmed, hand already on a dagger hilt. \"For now.\"\n\n\"Then we take the gift of distance,\" Serana said, and set them moving again.\n\nThey left the mountain to its long arithmetic—counting, waiting, patient as chains—and followed a narrower math: miles to town, hours to water, steps to sleep.\n\nBehind them, the Forge Road's cave mouth went back to being rock. The junction chambers settled into their new geometry. And somewhere vast and deep, something chained counted heartbeats that weren't its own.\n\nThud.\n\nThud.\n\nThud.\n\nAhead, the sky was very blue and very cruel and very free.\n\n\n\nEND CHAPTER 7\n\n\n\nWord Count: ~18,400 words",

                "text": "Act I — After the Ridge\n\n\n\nDawn found them already moving, the mountain at their backs like a dark thought they refused to turn and entertain. The air changed first—thin cold bleeding into crisp, pine-sweet breath with a mineral bite from distant streams. Lichen-glow gave way to frost-silvered scrub; then the path stitched itself through scattered firs and the soil began to smell like earth again instead of old stone.\n\n\"Millbrook's the closest roof that won't fall on us,\" Thornik said, voice low, practical. \"Temple wards, a licensed healer, and a smith who won't insult my beard. We get clean water, mended kit, and news.\"\n\nSerana nodded without looking back. \"Temple first. Water second. Decisions after.\" Her tone made it an order and a prayer at once.\n\nCaelin said nothing. The scale in his forearm had settled to a coal-glow—steady, sullen heat that throbbed in time with his heartbeat. The lattice of ember-filaments ached like overworked muscle, a constant message written under the skin: Still here. Still costing. He walked with his right arm close to his side, conserving everything he could, counting steps when thoughts tried to circle the collapse.\n\nNyxara kept pace a little behind and to his left, favoring her ankle. She wore her gloves again, black leather cut close, immaculate despite the miles. She didn't explain. She never did. The gloves stayed, and no one in the world needed the sight hidden beneath them.\n\nDurgan took rearguard. The shadow at his boots behaved—mostly. Every so often it stretched a finger's width too far toward the path they'd just walked, as if reaching back for the mountain's darkness; each time his jaw tightened and it went flat again. When a trickle of red touched his upper lip he wiped it away on a dark sleeve and kept moving. No one commented. Maybe they didn't see. Maybe they pretended not to.\n\nVex moved quiet at the flank, her shoulder bound high and tight under her cloak. She spared her right arm, used her left to balance on the scree. Her breath ghosted in the cold. She didn't complain. She never did either.\n\nSomewhere far behind, the mountain gave a last, reluctant echo: thud… thud… The sound thinned with every switchback, not nearer or farther so much as fainter—like a heartbeat heard through a wall you were walking away from.\n\n\n\nThe Spring\n\nThey found a spring where the path shouldered under a shelf of granite, water humming through old ironweed and moss. It smelled clean—green-cold and metallic—and the relief of it stole conversation from their mouths.\n\nThey drank. Washed dust from faces and hands. No one went for wounds until they'd filled skins; old habits, soldier's habits.\n\nThe healer's words from another life, another town, rose uninvited in Caelin's mind: \"Not the same as your druid.\" He could almost hear Elowen laugh at that. He pressed his lips to the waterskin and swallowed the ache down with the cold. The scale warmed in answer, as if approving the discipline of silence over words.\n\n\"Two hours to the treeline,\" Thornik said, consulting a sweat-curled page from his grandfather's journal. \"Four to Millbrook if the track holds.\"\n\n\"Make it three,\" Vex said, squinting downhill. \"Smoke over the flats. Small plumes. Breakfast fires or too many chimneys for a village that size.\"\n\n\"Refugees,\" Serana said. Not a question.\n\nThey moved on.\n\n\n\nApproach: Treeline\n\nThe path widened under trees, frost giving way to the sharp sweetness of crushed needles and the tannin breath of bark warmed by a weak sun. Birds stitched sound into the branches—nervous, thin. Civilization announced itself in small ways: a cut fencepost with fresh tool-marks; a snare hanging empty and forgotten; wheel ruts pressed pale into the hard ground.\n\n\"Closest warded town means closest news,\" Thornik added, half to himself as he walked. \"We need a read on the valleys. If the corruption's pushed this far south, Depth—\" He stopped himself, glancing at Caelin, then at Serana. \"We'll have choices to make.\"\n\n\"We will,\" Serana said. She didn't say when I can hear Her again. She didn't say if.\n\nNyxara's gaze flicked to Caelin's hand. \"How's the fire?\"\n\n\"Here.\" He flexed his fingers. The lattice answered with a thread of heat and a bruise-deep throb. \"Manageable.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She let the subject die, the way a person did when the answer didn't change the plan.\n\nThe last of the mountain's voice fell away behind them—no more stone-deep thudding, only the hush of needles and the quiet complaint of boots. When the trees broke at a low saddle, the land opened like a held breath: fields winter-bare, the river flashing dull pewter to the east, and on a rise beyond, a palisade and a scatter of roofs.\n\nMillbrook.\n\nSmoke ribbons lifted from within the walls, not frantic, not yet. A bell clanged once in the distance; not alarm. A call to market, or prayer, or inventory.\n\n\"Temple. Water. Healer. Smith.\" Serana looked down the slope. \"And someone who can tell us what the valley knows.\"\n\n\"Captain on the gate'll do,\" Vex said, scanning the wall-walk. \"If he's half-awake.\"\n\nDurgan's shadow reached a hair's breadth past his heel like a dog testing a leash. He stepped forward and it obeyed, flat again, obedient for now.\n\nCaelin adjusted the strap on his pack with his left hand. The right stayed close, heat-shadows flickering under the skin where the scale lived. He told the pain the same thing he'd told it all morning: later. He told the grief: later.\n\nThey started down toward the east gate and the promise of a town that might—just might—hold a night's peace.",

                "text": "Act II — The East Gate of Millbrook\n\n\n\nThey reached the east palisade as the market bell faded. Archers watched from the walk, bows half-drawn; on the ground, six spear-bearers braced like nails hammered into the mud. Millbrook smelled of wet leather, woodsmoke, and too many bodies jammed behind timber walls.\n\n\"State your business,\" called a man in a plain breastplate with the posture of someone who'd slept in armor all week. Weather-browned face, scar at the jaw hinge, eyes that missed very little.\n\nSerana stepped forward, gauntlet lifted so her order's sigil—sunburst over scales—caught the light. \"Serana Valeblade, ordained paladin. Refugees from Thornwick ruins. We bring warning, and swords.\"\n\nHis gaze flicked from the sigil to her stance, to the party's weapons, back to her eyes. He made a decision you could hear in his breath. \"Captain Vale,\" he said. \"We're short on courage and long on problems. Gates open.\"\n\nThe twin leaves thudded back. They entered into a corridor of sharpened logs and boiled leather—murder-hole roof overhead, oil stink in the slats. Precaution had a smell here: tallow, pitch, and anxious sweat.\n\nVale fell in beside Serana as they walked, not quite deferential but close. \"Order sigils carry ward-rights in this province. I'll keep muster and law, but if you're taking the line, my guard will pivot to your shield-wall. Agreed?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Serana said. No hesitation. No flourish. Command clicked into place with the ease of a habit she was scared she'd lost.\n\n\n\nInside the Walls\n\nMillbrook had doubled itself in a week. Cart wheels stacked against sheds; laundry lines slung across alleys; a stew of accents where there should have been one. Children stared at the weapons with the dry-eyed calm of people who had run too far too fast.\n\nVale walked them along the palisade. \"Pressure from the north trace,\" he said, tapping weak spots as they passed. \"Sporadic, but learning. Refugees say fire first, then the shadow-things. We hold after dark with lantern patrols and salt-lines across the lanes. Won't hold forever.\"\n\nThornik ran a hand over a gate hinge worn shiny with worry. \"That pin's about to shear.\" He fished in his coat, then stopped, thumb finding only leather. A brief count across his harness—empty sockets where devices should be. His mouth thinned. \"I can brace it for now. Proper fix later.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" Vale said. \"I don't care if it looks ugly, I care if it swings.\"\n\nThornik hauled out a smith's hammer—old, honest steel—and set to work, the ring of metal carrying like a small prayer. He didn't explain the empty harness; the emptiness explained itself.\n\nNyxara drifted peripheral to the conversation, gloves immaculate, hood shadowing her expression. She moved like someone who understood attention was a currency and spent none of it here.\n\nDurgan hung on the tail of the tour, silent sentinel. When a thin red line started at his nostril he turned his head and wiped it away on the black of his sleeve, the mark vanishing into cloth and shadow. Vale didn't notice. Or pretended not to. Good captains chose their moments.\n\n\n\nHealer's House\n\n\"Your Ember-bearer looks rung out,\" Vale said, practical. \"Our licensed sawbones kept two caravans alive last month. Temple's down the hill if you'd rather sermons than stitches.\"\n\n\"Both,\" Serana said. \"Healer first.\"\n\nThe healer's house tasted of boiled herbs and bitter bark; bundles dried from the rafters like wind-bell chimes. A woman with iron-gray hair and the narrow hands of her craft waved Caelin to a stool and prodded gently around the black-gleam scale in his forearm.\n\n\"Tell me what you've been using for the pain,\" she said, businesslike.\n\n\"A friend,\" Caelin answered before he could edit it. \"A druid. She used to take the worst of it.\"\n\nThe healer's eyes softened a fraction. \"Not the same as your druid,\" she told him bluntly, but her touch gentled. \"I can dull the edges. Can't argue with a relic.\" She packed a poultice at the tendons, wrapped him with clean linen that smelled of willow and camphor. \"You'll breathe easier. That will have to do.\"\n\nIt did—barely. The lattice stayed hot, but the knife-edges felt further from the bone.\n\n\n\nThe Note\n\nBack on the street, Caelin re-shouldered his pack one-handed—and felt paper crinkle where there shouldn't be any. He frowned, stepped out of the lane's foot-traffic, and slid a folded square free from beneath the collar of his spare shirt.\n\nPlain, waxless, not there this morning.\n\nInside, a tight, neat hand:\n\nEmber-bearer,\n\nDepthspire wakes.\n\nTwo weeks northeast if you don't get clever.\n\nDon't be late.\n\n— L.\n\nHe showed Serana, then Vex. Vale glanced once, mind already circling town defense, and didn't pry.\n\n\"L?\" Vex said, brows up.\n\n\"Later,\" Serana decided. \"Walls first.\"\n\nCaelin tucked the note back where it had appeared. The paper felt colder than it should in his fingers. When he slid it away, the skin over the scale warmed in reply, like disagreement.\n\n\n\nMuster\n\nBy late afternoon, Vale had them on a fast circuit through Millbrook's beating heart. Serana walked the wall with him, calling positions and fall-backs; the guards took her orders without side-eye because the sigil made it law and the steadiness in her voice made it easy. Vex ghosted the lanes, mapping alleys and choke points and escape routes with a thief's pragmatism. Thornik shored the hinge with a wedge and two bolts and a prayer, then started cataloguing where scrap iron could be made into stakes. Durgan stayed paired with a lantern-man at the western walk; the shadow at his boots behaved when looked at and misbehaved when not, which was the nature of certain problems. Nyxara vanished for an hour and returned with dried ink at the edge of her glove and a scent of old vellum—wherever she'd gone, it had books and wards and a keeper who owed her a favor.\n\nAs the sun slid, Vale faced Serana at the inner gate. \"We drill the bells at dusk,\" he said. \"If you've got a better line, I'll take it.\"\n\nSerana's jaw flexed like she wanted to pray and couldn't find where to put the words. \"We hold the market square,\" she said instead. \"Light, angles, lanes. We make them come to us.\"\n\nVale nodded once. \"Right. I'll put the green boys on the left, veterans at the well. Your people anchor the street from the mill. We answer your calls.\" He glanced at the sigil again, then at her eyes. \"Try not to get us killed, Paladin.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can,\" she said. It was almost a joke and almost a vow.",

A cartwheel argued with a rut and lost. Normalcy stacked itself high enough to be worth falling from.\n\nThey procured soap, a length of decent rope, a handful of nails Thornik admired as if they were art, and bread with enough heat left in it to sting fingers. Caelin carried the loaf under his good arm and learned that you can remember a person with your nose as easily as any other way. Three more breaths of it and he knew exactly which market stall Elowen would have gone to first, and what she would have said to the baker, and why that was exactly the kind of thing that was going to keep ambushing him for a long time.\n\n\n\nQuiet Rooms\n\nNyxara asked Vale for \"a door that locks and a basin that doesn't leak.\" He gave her a narrow cell behind the archive. She closed the bolt and peeled her gloves off in the shadowed light—flesh blackened at the fingertips where death-magic had taken its rent. Linen. Oil. The practiced ritual of binding and unbinding. Not performance; maintenance. Out of sight because sometimes strength is simply privacy.\n\nBy the time she reemerged, the gloves were back on, immaculate as always, and no one had been invited to pity.\n\n\n\nA Healer's Word\n\nCaelin's new bandage smelled of willow and camphor. The healer had done what she could: dulled the edges, steadied his breath. \"Not the same as your druid,\" she'd said, and he hadn't asked how she knew—because he'd told her, softly, before he could stop himself. Elowen's name didn't cross his lips; it didn't have to. The ache made a name of its own.\n\nOn the walk back, Vex paced him without comment. When his step hitched on a pothole, her hand shot out and steadied his elbow as if she hadn't meant to. She let go just as quickly, pretending she hadn't.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\n\"Watch your feet,\" she replied, sharpening the words to hide the softness inside them.\n\n\n\nThe Copper Ladle\n\nMillbrook's main tavern wore its age in grooves on the floorboards and soot in the rafters. The Copper Ladle's low ceiling trapped smoke and noise in equal measure. Refugees packed the benches, their conversations a blend of fear and forced normalcy. Vale took the corner bench with Serana to walk the defensive map again; Vex ghosted to a column with clear sight of both doors; Durgan planted himself by the back exit and watched shadows decide if they wanted to misbehave.\n\nCaelin shouldered through the press toward an empty table, the scale's heat making his arm ache worse in the crowded warmth.\n\n\"The Ember-born.\" The voice was silk over steel, carrying easily over the tavern's din. \"Fortune smiles—I'd begun to worry you'd take another route entirely.\"\n\nThe speaker rose from a corner table with practiced grace—dark hair, amber eyes that catalogued everything, expensive leather armor that looked effortlessly casual. Maps and journals spread before him like a merchant's wares, a bottle of Stormhaven red already half-empty. Five cups waited with the patience of a man accustomed to getting his way.\n\n\"Jasper Coinblight, at your considerable service.\" He gestured to the empty chairs with a flourish that somehow didn't look theatrical. \"Information broker, relic hunter, and—if the cards fall favorably—your guide to wealth beyond imagining. Please, do sit. The wine is exceptional, the company promises to be memorable, and the conversation will be worth considerably more than both.\"\n\nVex's hand drifted toward a dagger hilt. \"You've been waiting for us specifically.\"\n\n\"Waiting implies passivity. I prefer 'strategically positioned along probable routes.'\" Jasper's smile could have charmed coin from a miser's purse. \"When the dragon-marked and his remarkable companions depart Thornwick heading east, certain destinations become statistically likely. And statistics, my dear shadow-dancer, are simply opportunities wearing numbers.\"\n\nCaelin felt the scale pulse steady—no white-hot sting of deception. Whatever else this man was, he believed his own silver tongue.\n\n\"You know where we're going,\" Serana said. Not a question.\n\n\"I know where you must go.\" Jasper spread his maps across the table with the reverence of a priest laying out scripture. \"Depthspire. The Concord's most ambitious prison-vault, and quite possibly their most catastrophically brilliant mistake.\"\n\nHe traced elegant fingers across the largest map. \"Picture, if you will, a fortress designed not merely to store treasures, but to defend them using the very monsters too dangerous to kill. Corrupted mages. Possessed warriors. Things that slipped through conjuration rifts and refused to die politely. The Concord imprisoned them alongside their most valuable relics and artifacts.\"\n\n\"Using prisoners as guards?\" Thornik's scholarly interest overrode his caution.\n\n\"As a living security system.\" Jasper's eyes gleamed. \"Adaptive, intelligent, and utterly motivated. Each prisoner positioned between entrance and vault, each one desperate for freedom and quite willing to kill anyone foolish enough to offer the opportunity.\" He paused for effect. \"Brilliance and horror in equal measure, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n\"Three entrances,\" Jasper continued, tapping locations. \"East—heavily guarded by what remains of the prison's original wardens. Inadvisable. South—flooded for decades, structurally unsound. Suicidal. West—the deep prison levels where, curiously enough, the wards are failing and certain occupied cells are beginning to open.\"\n\nCaelin's scale warmed at that. \"The doors are opening?\"\n\n\"Indeed. And here's where your particular destiny intersects with my professional aspirations.\" Jasper leaned forward, all business now despite the smooth delivery. \"As the Nine relics awaken—as that remarkable scale of yours came alive—the binding magic weakens. The prisoners are stirring. Some cells have already failed. The dungeon becomes more dangerous every day.\"\n\n\"But also more accessible,\" Vex finished, understanding dawning.\n\n\"Precisely.\" Jasper's smile acknowledged her sharp mind. \"You must traverse all three levels to reach the vault itself. One relic waits there—a piece of your grand puzzle. Plus sufficient treasures to fund, oh, a dozen expeditions.\" He spread his hands. \"What I'm proposing is a partnership of enlightened self-interest.\"\n\n\"You want a share,\" Vex said flatly.\n\n\"I want to survive long enough to spend it.\" Jasper met her mismatched eyes without flinching. \"I've researched Depthspire for three years. I know the approach, the architecture, the legends. More importantly, I have an associate whose particular talents make him utterly invaluable for what we're attempting.\"\n\n\"What kind of associate?\" Serana asked carefully.\n\nJasper's smile turned enigmatic. \"The kind the Copper Ladle refuses to serve. Something about rats and smell.\" He stood smoothly. \"But words do him disservice—you should meet him yourselves. He's waiting outside, as taverns have become rather inhospitable to his unique charms.\"\n\nHe moved toward the door, then paused. \"Fair warning: Puddle is an acquired taste. But he possesses skills that will mean the difference between reaching that vault and becoming another cautionary tale.\" His amber eyes held something that might have been genuine respect. \"One week. West entrance. Don't be late—the dungeon doesn't improve with age.\"\n\n\n\nOutside in the Alley\n\nThe alley was dark, narrow, smelling of rain-soaked wood and old barrel rot. Jasper led them around the tavern's side where shadows pooled thick.\n\n\"Puddle?\" he called. \"Our potential associates have agreed to an introduction.\"\n\nMovement along the wall—something scuttling with unsettling fluidity.\n\nA figure emerged from the shadows.\n\nSmall. Barely five feet tall, hunched beneath a tattered dark cloak that looked like it had been stitched from a dozen different rags. Greenish skin caught the moonlight, and a broad, almost manic grin split his face, showing prominent teeth. Oversized eyes gleamed with cheerful intensity beneath the hood. Multiple pouches hung from a belt alongside small cages—some occupied by small, squeaking shapes. He gripped a gnarled walking stick, and perched on his shoulders, tucked into pockets, one even nestled in his hood—\n\n\"Hello! Puddle is Puddle! And these are Puddle's friends!\" The half-orc gestured proudly to the rats with his free hand, the movement making them adjust positions with practiced ease.\n\nThe smell arrived a heartbeat later: earthy, musty, cheese, underground.\n\n\"Too bright out here. Puddle prefers dark. Dark is safe! Lights make Puddles squinty!\"\n\n\"Puddle Thrym,\" Jasper introduced smoothly. \"The finest tunnel-runner, dungeon-mapper, and all-around subterranean specialist currently breathing.\"\n\nPuddle beamed at the praise. \"Fire-mark! Metal-beard! Shiny-paladin! Dark-lady! Pretty-knife-lady! Quiet-man-with-funny-shadow!\" He'd named them all instantly, head tilting at each in turn.\n\n\"Your... friends?\" Caelin asked carefully, gesturing toward the rats.\n\n\"Yes! Puddle's friends are very helpful!\" One of the rats—grey-brown with intelligent eyes—chittered at length. Puddle listened intently, nodding. \"Whiskers is very wise! Whiskers says Fire-mark smells like fire and old magic!\"\n\nHe tilted his head at Caelin, concerned. \"And... sadness? Why Fire-mark sad? Is Puddle's smell? Puddle can stand farther away!\"\n\n\"It's not your smell,\" Vex said, something almost gentle in her tone despite the absurdity of the conversation.\n\nPuddle brightened immediately. \"Good! Puddle works very hard on smell! Many years of sewer-living!\"\n\n\"Puddle's companions,\" Jasper explained with the patience of long practice, \"possess talents that conventional scouts lack. They can navigate spaces no human could access. And most crucially—they can map dungeons with remarkable accuracy.\"\n\n\"Friends go where big people can't! Friends see what big people miss! Puddle finds secret ways! Small tunnels! Drainage! Places metal-crushers don't see!\" His enthusiasm was infectious, despite the strangeness.\n\n\"Metal-crushers?\" Thornik asked.\n\n\"Big metal things that patrol,\" Puddle said matter-of-factly, then reached into one of his pouches and withdrew something small and dried. \"Puddle brings gift to celebrate partnership! Is very fresh jerky! Only died this morning!\"\n\nMoonlight caught it clearly: unmistakably rat-shaped.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Serana said immediately.\n\n\"Hard pass,\" Vex added.\n\nPuddle shrugged cheerfully and ate it himself, the crunch audible. \"More for Puddle then!\"\n\nJasper's smooth mask cracked into a genuine smile. \"As I said—acquired taste.\" He turned serious again. \"One week. West entrance. Puddle can map the dungeon as we go—find routes around the worst dangers, locate passages others would miss entirely.\"\n\n\"And if we decide this is suicide?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Then I'll find someone else who values the difference between 'impossible' and 'merely extraordinarily dangerous.'\" Jasper's amber eyes held calculation and something like respect. \"But I don't believe you will. You're heading to the Emberpeaks regardless—Depthspire is the only intact Concord structure in that range. The question isn't if you'll need us, but whether you'll be wise enough to accept the help before attempting it blind.\"\n\nPuddle produced a clay bottle from another pouch. \"Puddle has mushroom wine for celebrating! Makes tongue fuzzy! Very fun!\"\n\n\"No,\" came the immediate collective response.\n\n\"Suit yourselves.\" Jasper clapped Puddle's shoulder. \"Come along, my aromatic friend. We have preparations to make.\"\n\nPuddle waved cheerfully to the party, rats chittering in what might have been farewell. \"One week! West entrance! Puddle will be ready!\"\n\nHe grinned that broad, manic grin. \"Dark is better for traveling anyway!\"\n\nThe two disappeared into the barrel-shadows—Jasper's smooth grace and Puddle's hunched, scuttling gait. Distant squeaking faded into silence.\n\nThe party stood for a long moment.\n\n\"We're trusting our lives to that?\" Thornik said faintly.\n\n\"If we go,\" Caelin corrected. He looked back toward the warm light of the tavern. \"Right now we have a council to prepare for and a town to help hold.\"",

Captain Vale returned with a sister from the chapel, two gray-haired locals who looked like wheat had opinions, and someone who tried and failed not to be a clerk.\n\nThey asked sane questions. What had they seen? How far had the glass spread? Were there other survivors? The sister's eyes darted to Serana's insignia, then away. The clerk wrote as if ink could keep anyone safe.\n\nCaelin told the truth that would fit in a room. Thornik explained what he could without calling it worship. Vex left out every detail that would make anyone braver than they had a right to be. Durgan did not speak. Nyxara smiled when it helped. Serana's jaw clenched on old oaths and found no purchase.\n\nWhen it ended, Vale gave them the look of a man who knows there are wolves in the hills and has just learned they can climb fences. \"There'll be talk,\" he said. \"About Ember-born. About what you carry. It would be better if you didn't show it.\"\n\nCaelin tugged his sleeve down. \"Agreed.\"\n\nAfter they left, the inn felt older. The fiddle found its tuning. Someone sang a work song about rivers taking what they wanted. The room joined in because it knew how.\n\nAt the edge of the hearth's circle, Serana bowed her head over a bowl of stew gone cold and shaped her hands for prayer without speaking. Nothing came. No warmth, no direction, no sense of a presence at the other end of the gesture. After a while, she un-shaped her hands and ate mechanically. Caelin pretended not to see and succeeded the way men do when kindness would break something.\n\nElowen should have been here to complain about the taste of boiled fat. She would have catalogued it specifically: the grade of tallow, the wrong herbs, what the cook should have done differently. She would have complained with enough precision that it became funny. Caelin lifted his spoon and the scale warmed once like memory finding a handhold and let go.\n\nNight came down easy, which only meant it would be harder in the morning.",

When the room thinned to a few drunks and quiet chairs, Caelin joined him with two cups of water that steamed in the inn's honest heat.\n\n\"Quieter than the mountain,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Quieter makes men loud,\" Durgan said.\n\nThey sat in silence that had weight but not weapon. Outside, wind ran along the eaves. Somewhere a dog argued with a dream. The inn's stones breathed retained heat like a stored prayer no one believed in anymore.\n\n\"The mark,\" Durgan said without looking, \"does it ache or warn?\"\n\n\"Tonight? Neither. It listens.\" He flexed his fingers. \"It likes places with rules.\"\n\n\"Walls,\" Durgan said.\n\n\"Rooms. Schedules.\" Caelin half-smiled. \"Dinner at the same hour. The world pretending it can be persuaded.\"\n\nDurgan nodded. \"Don't let it teach you to trust that.\"\n\n\"You trust anything?\"\n\n\"Weight,\" Durgan said. \"And whether a rope's been kept dry.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—no color, just pressure—when a gust slipped under the door, bringing a breath of cold that remembered stone. Caelin put his palm flat on the table and steadied his own hum until it fell back to a human rhythm. No one else noticed. He preferred it that way.\n\nWhen he rose to wake Thornik for second watch, Durgan said, \"You kept moving when the rock wanted you to stop. Keep doing that.\" It was the closest the man came to comfort. It fit.\n\nUpstairs, Vex snored very carefully—quiet enough to deny it later. Thornik mumbled a formula in his sleep that resolved into the word stay. Serana lay on her back watching the ceiling as if it might answer, then turned and didn't ask. Caelin lay awake longer than he meant to, waiting for a hum that didn't come.\n\nThe town held through the night. The mountain did not call. Perhaps it was busy elsewhere. That was worse.",

The inn's hearth was already working on a gruel it called porridge. Vex declared it a war crime and ate two bowls.\n\nCaptain Vale waited near the door with the politeness of a man who doesn't like his own orders. \"Council wants you at midday.\" He hesitated. \"There's been talk. Traders on the south road swore they saw a light under the clouds. Not lightning. Steadier.\"\n\n\"Depthspire,\" Thornik said reflexively, then drank his tea as if that might hide the word. It didn't.\n\n\"Is that where you're going?\" Vale asked.\n\n\"We go where the pull goes,\" Caelin said, which was both non-answer and truth. \"After your council.\" He nodded toward the street. \"And after we help you fix the gate hinge that's going to break in the next strong wind.\"\n\nVale blinked. \"You saw that?\"\n\n\"Weight leaves signatures,\" Caelin said. \"Even on wood.\"\n\nThey spent an hour with Thornik at the gate: rope, a lever, a lesson in the faith of simple machines. Serana steadied the ladder without praying. Durgan held the hinge while two men hammered the pin through; no one asked how he made the weight look like it belonged there. Vex found the copper the girl-captain had taxed from Durgan yesterday and left it on the sill of a window with a broken pane.\n\nBy late morning, rumor had grown legs and a voice and moved faster than truth. The council hall filled with people who pretended to be calm about it. Vale walked them in as if they were contraband and good news.\n\nCaelin pulled his sleeve down again and let the scale stay dark. The pull inside him had gentled to a low thrum, patient as a debt. When he glanced north, the light through the windows had the color of cooled iron. Somewhere in that direction, a tower remembered being a wound.\n\n\"Ready?\" Vex asked, meaning for the council, meaning for whatever used to be a world.\n\n\"No,\" Caelin said. \"But I'm going anyway.\"\n\nThey crossed the threshold together.

Children were shooed under cellar hatches that smelled of earth, turnips, and fear. On the lane, chalk marks glowed faint in lantern light—Serana's secular ward-lines. Here hold. Here yield. Fall back to square at second bell. The guard captain's voice ran along the wall: \"Steady on—by files—mind your spacing.\"\n\nThey listened because of the charter-sigil on Serana's cloak and because Vale said \"Do it,\" and Vale had been telling them what to do for twelve winters and they were still alive.\n\nWind carried the wrong smell: damp stone, old iron, something like cold breath blown through a keyhole. Then the first of the shadow-thralls stepped out from behind the butcher's, bending wrong at the knee.\n\n\"Hold until I call,\" Serana said, shield lifting, voice level. Her light flickered—she made it steady with will alone.\n\nVale moved along the line like a man checking knots before a storm. \"Spears up. Eyes forward. When the paladin calls, you move. Not before.\"\n\nHe stopped at a boy of perhaps sixteen—spear too long, knuckles white on the haft. Vale squared the angle with one hand, said nothing. Then, quieter than the line needed to hear: \"You showed up. That's the part most men don't manage.\" He moved on.\n\n\n\nThe party split to assignments with the efficiency of people who'd learned to trust each other's competence even when they didn't trust each other.\n\nThornik took the wall, tool-harness mostly empty but hands steady on his axes. He touched the loops where charges used to nest—six left, maybe seven. He'd counted three times. \"Make them count,\" he muttered to no one.\n\nVex ghosted to the tower stairs, testing her wrapped shoulder with a roll that pulled but held. Another week and she'd forget it had been cut. For now, she'd just have to be faster.\n\nCaelin held the center near the square, right arm bound tight under his sleeve. The scale pulsed coal-glow—manageable, steady. He flexed his fingers. Pain sang through the lattice but didn't scream. He could work with that.\n\nNyxara took position at the gate, gloves immaculate, face calm. Her fingers had stiffened through the day but still flexed when she needed them to. Still worked. That would have to be enough.\n\nDurgan moved to the bucket-line's edge, blades loose in their sheaths, shadow obedient at his boots in the lantern-glow. For now.\n\nThe thralls came on too quiet.",

The silhouettes buckled as anatomy demanded; their shadows whipped, failing to find purchase against Serana's ward-line.\n\n\"On me!\" Serana barked, stepping to take a rake meant for a baker at the bucket line. Something stirred at her shoulder—habit, reflex—guttered before it could hold. She put her body between the blow and the question and did not flinch.\n\nThornik thumbed a charge and skipped it off the cobbles; it caromed under three thralls and went off with a shuddering cough of light and sound. One collapsed. Two more staggered, smoking.\n\n\"Five left,\" he grunted, already counting.\n\nDurgan's blades worked short and economical, every cut a lesson. His shadow dragged at him slightly, wanting, but he crushed it flat with jaw-locked effort and felt the warm trickle of a nosebleed vanish into the black of his collar. No one saw.\n\nCaelin kept center, throwing small heat—lines on steel, a melted hinge, a slick made glassy at the right instant. Pain flared, then steadied. Manageable.\n\n\n\nA scream cut through the chaos—civilian down in the square, leg twisted wrong.\n\nA voice cut through the noise—not a shout, a command, the kind that had been obeyed on fields worse than this: \"Don't move him! Spine's compromised!\"\n\nCaelin turned. A man knelt over the fallen villager—grey-bearded, built like two decades of campaign work that had never quite softened, hands moving with the unhurried speed of someone who'd stopped being surprised by injury somewhere around middle age. Battered medical bag, open on bloody cobbles. He didn't look up.\n\n\"You.\" This at a woman nearby. \"Neck brace. My bag. Green strap.\" Then to the wounded man, in the gentler voice of a carpenter addressing a split beam: \"You're going to live. I've pulled men through worse than this with less. The bad news is you're going to remember it.\" Then to Caelin, still not looking up: \"Are you bleeding?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then step aside. I have a limited amount of time and an unlimited amount of injured people.\"\n\nCaelin blinked, then grabbed a dropped spear and handed it to a shaking boy who needed something to hold more than he needed direction. When he looked back, the man had already moved to the next patient.\n\nLater, during a lull, he watched him splint a broken leg with a spear-shaft and someone's belt.\n\n\"Good news,\" the man told the screaming patient. \"You'll live. You'll walk with a limp that'll get you out of digging latrine pits for the rest of your natural life. In my experience that's a net positive.\"\n\nThe thralls retreated like smoke pulled backward through cracks.\n\nSecond bell rang.\n\n\"Fall back to the square!\" Vale's shout carried like a thrown rope. \"Mill Lane! Paladin—anchor!\"\n\n\"We're there,\" Serana answered, already moving.",

Villagers braced spears with white knuckles; Vale ran the line, tapping shoulders, fixing spacing, making fear into formation.\n\n\"Reserve on the right,\" he told a sergeant. \"When the paladin gives you the nod, you move. No heroics. We live.\"\n\nThe thralls came hard now, shadows flaring like oil under wind.\n\n\"Thornik!\" Vex called from the parapet. \"Left!\"\n\nHe burned two charges to break a rush that would have folded the line. The belt went lighter at his ribs. He tapped the emptiness with a grim snort. \"Three left. Then it's axes and prayer.\"\n\nNyxara was cool and surgical—veils of suggestion and stutters of hesitation blooming in enemy minds, buying heartbeats where heartbeats meant survival. She did not reach for the deeper well yet. Not yet.\n\nCaelin pushed harder. A spearline of red-gold leapt from his palm and cut a corridor through grasping shadows; a second cast flared broader, washing the cobbles clean for the bucket line to move. The lattice screamed inside his skin. He tasted copper. He did it anyway.\n\n\"Hold!\" Serana called, catching a blow on the boss of her shield that would have broken a door. Her light flickered. She made it burn. \"Hold—!\"\n\nThe line bent. It did not break.\n\nThen three thralls slipped the ward seam Vex was guarding.\n\nShe cut one's knee, hamstrung the second, rolled under the third and took its throat clean—then a fourth she hadn't seen came in low. The butt of its spear caught her temple. The world went sideways.\n\n\"Vex!\" Thornik shouted, trying to cut across, but the line surged to fill the gap and he was a beat too slow.\n\nCaelin turned and saw her folded at an angle wrong for living things.\n\nSomething in him broke open.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nFire answered.\n\nNot careful. Not neat. A blast-front roared across half the square, a dragon's exhale made narrow by brutal will. Thralls ignited in a red-gold bloom; their shadows screamed and fled like ink in boiling water. The nearest barrels scorched; bucket-men fell back with singed hair and wide eyes.\n\nPain tore him hollow. The lattice lit with searing white, every filament a wire pulled too taut. For a heartbeat he thought the scale would split his arm from the inside.\n\nHe stumbled through the heat he'd made, fell to his knees beside Vex.\n\nPulse—where was her pulse—\n\nThere. Thready. There.\n\nFootsteps. The old man dropped beside him, fingers already at Vex's throat, checking pupils with a thumb that forced her eyelid up with zero ceremony.\n\n\"Concussion. Head trauma. Broken rib.\" He started wrapping with brutal efficiency. \"Touch and go.\"\n\nCaelin's throat closed. \"Will she—\"\n\n\"Don't know yet.\" No false comfort. Just bandages pulled tight. \"Keep her breathing. Keep her still. That's all we can do right now.\"\n\nThe man looked up at Caelin's arm, at the scale visible under blood-stained bandages. \"Did you just scream fire across a battlefield?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Objectively terrifying.\" He tied off the wrap. \"Also, thank you. She'd be dead without it.\"\n\nHe stood, moved to the next wounded, didn't look back.\n\nCaelin stayed beside Vex, one hand near hers, counting breaths.\n\nMovement—wrong, close. A thrall's shadow reached toward his shoulder.\n\nHe had to move or die.\n\nHe stood through the pain and turned back into the fight.",

Vale went to meet them.\n\nHe fought like a man who'd practiced near a thousand nights for this one—no wasted motion, no glory in it. He put his body where the line was thinnest and made it thick again. He looked toward Serana once; she nodded once; there was understanding.\n\nWhen the spear came from the side—slick black, more spike than wood—he shoved a boy out of its path and took it clean through the ribs. He finished his stroke anyway, pinned one more shadow-thing to the stones, refused to fall until falling would close the gap he'd held.\n\n\"On me,\" he said once, voice wet, and the reserve swung like a gate because he'd taught them to hear that tone and obey it.\n\nSerana saw him go. Her jaw set. \"Hold,\" she said, softer, as if she could make the word a covering.\n\nThe old man reached him first, dropped beside him, hands already moving to assess the wound. Stopped. The spear had gone through cleanly, and what it carried in its wake was already spreading—corruption, wrongness, the kind of wound no bandage could fix.\n\n\"I can fix broken,\" he said, voice tight with the particular frustration of a craftsman given an impossible job. \"I can't fix this.\"\n\nHe met Vale's eyes—still clear, still present—and understood. Covered his face with clean cloth when it was done, stood, moved to the next patient who could be saved.\n\nThornik roared in Dwarvish and split a thrall at the collarbone. The shock of the blow traveled up his arms and lit old breaks; he kept swinging.\n\nDurgan moved like a grim machine. Once, his shadow pulled toward the enemy's at the corners of light—just a heartbeat, just enough to notice. He forced it flat and cut what needed cutting. Blood ran from his nose again; the collar caught it.\n\nNyxara finally reached down to the place she'd been avoiding.\n\nShe whispered in a language that wasn't spoken so much as remembered; frost formed along the lintels; breath smoked. Something stepped up out of absence at her call—a hound built of rib-bones and blue witchlight, eyes like lanterns in fog.\n\n\"Fetch,\" she told it, voice steady. It went without hesitation and broke a thrall at the knees with a crack like a branch under ice.\n\nA corpse behind the barricade rose at her second word—its face wrapped in a strip of sackcloth she tied without flinching. It fought for them, clumsy, obedient, and bought four lives before it fell again.\n\nThe price walked into her hands. The gloves hid the color change, but she felt fingertips go colder, deader, one joint beginning to separate where tendon met bone. She bound that knowledge behind a perfect expression and kept working.",

Her shield slammed into a leader's chest; the line stepped; the reserve flowed; the square held.\n\nAnd then—like a thread cut—the thralls began to break.\n\nThey did not run so much as fold and vanish, remnants sinking back into cracks they had no right to fit.\n\nSilence arrived the way it always does after a fight that large: not as absence but as presence, a new thing settling over the square with weight. The moaning and dripping and the meaningless roll of a loose bucket across cobblestones—all of it still there, all of it somehow part of the silence rather than breaking it. The kind of quiet that means there is nothing left to kill and your body hasn't learned that yet.\n\nCaelin's arm was a column of white heat from shoulder to wrist. He became aware, slowly, that he was still holding a fighting stance and made himself lower it. The lattice ticked and began to cool by degrees. He looked down at his hand. Still there. Still attached. That felt like more than he deserved.\n\nThornik stood with an axe in each fist and his belt empty and blood on his beard that wasn't all his own. He ran his eyes across the square the way a man counts coin—methodical, not hopeful. When he reached zero on the charge loops, he exhaled once through his nose. Then he put the axes away.\n\nDurgan went very still at the square's edge. His shadow lay flat and honest at his boots in the torchlight. He pressed the back of his wrist to his nose. Dry. He checked again. Habit. He exhaled once, slow, like a man easing a door closed so it didn't wake anyone.\n\nVex hadn't moved. She was breathing. Caelin could see it from here. That was what mattered.\n\nSilence after battle felt like a held breath finally released.\n\nThe third bell rang once, useless, telling a town that already knew to stop fighting because there was nothing left to kill.",

The smell was sweat, pitch, cooked iron, and the bitter, wrong scent the thralls left behind.\n\n\"Water on the east thatch!\" a sergeant called—Vale's echo in his voice, trying to fill a space that couldn't be filled.\n\nAldric worked in the center of the square, surrounded by wounded, hands moving with the mechanical rhythm of someone past exhaustion who has no intention of stopping. When Caelin approached, he didn't look up from wrapping a farmer's arm.\n\n\"Everyone needs a healer,\" he said. \"Get in line.\"\n\n\"She's still breathing,\" Caelin said quietly.\n\nAldric's hands stilled for just a heartbeat. \"Good. Keep it that way.\" He tied off the bandage, moved to the next patient. \"Wake me if she stops.\"\n\n\n\nThey moved bodies to the south lane and covered them with clean sheets that smelled of sun and soap. Captain Vale lay among them, his hands crossed over the spear that had saved a boy who stood ten feet away and couldn't understand why he was still standing.\n\nSerana knelt. Her light failed to gather. She prayed anyway, voice a rasp. \"Guide him. He kept his watch.\" The words landed because she said them, light or no.\n\nThornik found the hinge at the east gate had splintered under blast and weight. No one asked. He set his hammer against the bent pin and began to work the metal back true. Tap, heat, wedge. His tool-harness hung empty at his ribs, loops that should have held cleverness now just leather and air. He worked anyway, the old way, with sweat and stubbornness.\n\nNyxara did not linger in the square once the dead were counted and the living were moving. She took a narrow stair to the little room behind the archive, slid the bolt, and sat very still until the tremor in her hands stopped.\n\nThe gloves would come off later, in private. The accounting would be done where no one could see what she'd become.\n\nDurgan cleaned his blades with method that could have been prayer. His shadow lay obedient at his boots; his shoulders were too square. When the nosebleed started again, he pressed the heel of his hand to it and turned slightly so the dark cloth drank the red. He kept his eyes on Caelin across the square and told himself that standing here was still a choice he was making.\n\n\n\nCaelin found Aldric on an upturned bucket at the square's edge, stitching a cut in his own forearm with the calm of a man mending a saddle.\n\n\"You do that yourself?\" Caelin asked.\n\n\"Every time.\" Aldric bit the thread. \"Forty years of practice. You get good at it or you get dead, and I've always had a mild preference for the first option.\"\n\nCaelin crouched. \"You're not from Millbrook.\"\n\n\"No.\" Aldric rolled his sleeve down. \"Third Harrow Company, retired. Field surgeon fifteen years, then walking between towns for another ten patching whoever needed patching.\" He paused. \"I was attached to the garrison at Veln's Post when the seals started failing two years ago. Forty men. Good men, most of them—well-trained, sensible, the sort who ate their vegetables and didn't gamble more than they could lose.\" He said it with the flat affect of someone who'd had time to turn the memory into something he could carry. \"Thirty-seven of them died to something that came through the lower vault. I couldn't cut it out. Couldn't bandage it. Couldn't do a single useful thing.\"\n\n\"You survived.\"\n\n\"I was in the east tower when it happened. A healer who was somewhere else when people needed healing.\" He looked at his hands once, briefly, then didn't again. \"Since then I've been trying to get back into the plateau's border country. Find out what came through that vault. Find out if the other sealed vaults are next.\"\n\nCaelin said, carefully: \"Veln's Post is Depthspire's eastern approach.\"\n\n\"I know where it is.\"\n\nA beat. \"We're going in. North, toward Depthspire.\"\n\n\"I know what you are.\" Aldric nodded at Caelin's wrapped arm. \"Saw the mark when you were on your knees beside the woman. Knew what you were about.\" He stood, joints filing their usual complaints. \"You'll need a healer. That plateau has spent the last two years demonstrating that it can open people up in ways that don't respond well to wishful thinking.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a reason to stay away,\" Vex said from behind Caelin. He hadn't heard her cross the square.\n\n\"That's what the thirty-seven thought,\" Aldric said pleasantly, \"before they stopped having opinions.\" He looked at Vex's shoulder with the eyes of a man who'd assessed a great many wounds and was unimpressed by what he was seeing. \"That wrap needs redoing. Sit down.\"\n\nVex sat down.\n\n\n\nShe woke near midnight. Caelin was there, which she registered before she registered anything else.\n\n\"Six,\" he said, when her eyes focused. \"Before you fell. In case you were counting.\"\n\n\"Seven,\" she said. \"You missed one at the drainpipe.\"\n\nHe almost smiled. \"How's your head?\"\n\n\"Feels like someone rang it like a bell.\" She shifted, winced, settled. \"Vale?\"\n\nThe almost-smile went away. \"He saved people. We'll say his name right.\"\n\nShe was quiet a moment. Then: \"This Aldric. He any good?\"\n\n\"He stitched his own arm without flinching and told a man with a broken leg that it was a net positive. I think he'll do.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" She closed her eyes. \"Don't let him touch my shoulder again while I'm awake. He's not gentle.\"\n\n\"He said you'd say that. He said if you say that, he was right about the wrap and you can thank him later.\"\n\nVex said something short and accurate about Aldric's bedside manner and went back to sleep.\n\n\n\nNight came early, as it does after battles. Millbrook slept in ragged shifts.\n\nCaelin sat outside on the stable step and watched the sky find stars one at a time. The scale had settled lower than it had been in days—the scream-cast had burned something down to a truer level, cleared some pressure he hadn't known had been building. He flexed his fingers in the dark. The lattice answered steady and sullen, like a fire that had stopped trying to be impressive and committed to just burning.\n\nHe looked north. The scale warmed a fraction—the same direction it had been pointing since the mountain, patient as a compass needle. Somewhere out there the Depthspire aurora had written curtains across the sky. Somewhere out there L's note said two weeks. Somewhere out there thirty-seven men from Veln's Post were owed an answer.\n\nThe third bell had rung too late. Millbrook held, but Vale was gone, and the cost of holding felt heavier than the victory.\n\nHe let that sit. He wasn't going to argue with it. He let it settle beside the other things he was carrying, and then he went in to sleep in pieces, the way you do after battles, and let the north wait until morning.",

She came down the loft's shadow-ladder of the stable and stopped in the dark beneath the last rafter, away from the door. The left glove came off.\n\nShe held the hand up in the thin grey light coming through the gap in the boards. The fingertips were black to the second knuckle now. The skin had the texture of something that had been cold too long—not dead, not yet, but learning the direction. She flexed each finger in turn, feeling the nerves report from their diminished distance. Not pain exactly. More like the memory of pain, arriving late and quiet. She counted the joints. Same number as yesterday. She had stopped being grateful for that and started just counting.\n\nThe glove went back on before she stepped into the yard.\n\n\n\nShe crossed the square alone. The cobbles were still scorched in places where Caelin's fire had swept through; the barricade had been pulled aside but not yet cleared, and someone had left a bucket where a man had died. The smell of the night before hung in the cold air—pitch, iron, the strange wrong-sweetness the thralls left behind. She walked through it without slowing. She had learned early that the best way to move through a bad place was to move through it.\n\nShe found Caelin where she'd expected—on the stable step in the early cold, carefully re-wrapping his arm, testing the grip against the ache. He didn't try to stand when she approached. It would cost too much.\n\nA thumb-sized mirror-coin lay in her palm, frost veining the face from the inside.\n\n\"Summoned,\" she said. \"And I was told to tell you. You, specifically.\"\n\n\"By your patron?\" He kept his eyes on the wrap.\n\nShe tilted the coin; the frost vanished as if swallowed. \"When they call, I go. And right now I'm held together with spite and linen. If I cast like I did yesterday, I'll lose these.\" She lifted the gloved hand. He knew what was under it. \"Next time it's the hand. Then the arm.\"\n\nHe nodded once. \"Do you want me to tell the others?\"\n\n\"In a bit.\" She pressed a looped obsidian sliver into his palm. \"One breath where lies land like truth. Spend it to buy time, not fate.\"\n\nBefore he could answer, she drew out a narrow dark ribbon knotted with a hair-fine thread of silver. \"Tie it under your sleeve. If I'm within about a hundred miles, the silver will shade darker. Not a map—just nearness.\"\n\nHe studied it. \"That helps.\"\n\nShe didn't add—and he didn't ask—that the knot carried a return thread only she could read; that if she needed to find him, the ribbon answered her too.\n\n\"Anything else I should know?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only this.\" She took his wrist, quick and careful, and tied the ribbon for him beneath the wrap where it wouldn't show. \"I'm going because I must, not because I want to. And—\" her grin flashed, wicked even through exhaustion \"—try not to exhaust yourself without me. I'd hate to miss it.\"\n\nEven hurt, he huffed a laugh. \"No promises.\"\n\n\"Good boy.\" Two fingers—the least ruined—touched his cheek, almost ceremonial. \"Walk with ghosts if you must. Don't become one to keep them company.\"\n\nShe stepped away into the lane. The yard felt larger behind her—like a tent after the heat has gone.\n\n\n\nII. The Group Hears\n\n\n\nThe morning after a siege sounds like a town remembering how to breathe. Somewhere a hammer worked at timber. A child cried, then stopped. The smell of fresh bread moved through smoke-tinged air from a bakehouse that had stayed lit through everything, because bread doesn't care about thralls.\n\nThey were checking tack and repacking what hadn't burned in the stable yard when Caelin said, \"Nyx was summoned. She left word that she doesn't know when—or if—she'll be back.\"\n\nThe words landed in different ways on different people.\n\nVex set down a saddlebag with more care than usual—her ribs announcing themselves with every twist. \"Wonderful. Fewer purple fireworks and unsolicited philosophy.\" She pulled a strap tight and checked the buckle twice. A beat passed. Softer, grudging: \"Also fewer brain-scrambles when death squads show up, so... I suppose I'll miss the asset. A little.\" She slid a dagger home. \"Don't tell her I said that.\"\n\nThornik scratched his beard with a knuckle, eyes on the middle distance. \"Wouldn't dare. She'd charge us for sentiment.\"\n\nSerana only nodded, eyes already on the road that led east. She'd been looking at it since first light. \"We keep moving.\"\n\nDurgan said nothing. He stood at the yard's edge, blades already cleaned and sheathed, shadow flat and obedient at his feet in the morning sun. If the news moved him, it moved him in a place no one could see.\n\nThey worked in quiet for a while—the productive, necessary quiet of people packing for a journey they're not sure they're coming back from. Rolled blankets, counted coin, checked the edge on steel that had been used the night before and would be used again.\n\nAcross the yard, Aldric was inventorying his medical bag with the thorough patience of someone who'd learned the cost of discovering a shortage at the wrong moment. He didn't participate in the conversation. He listened the way old soldiers listen—head down, cataloguing, missing nothing.\n\n\n\nIII. Thornik's Choice\n\n\n\nThey found Thornik behind the smithy, where the local smith had let him use the corner of a workbench. He'd laid his tools out in a row—not randomly, but the way a soldier lays out equipment for inspection, each item in its place, each absence accounted for. The empty charge-loops from his harness. A cracked lens. The housing for a device that no longer had a mechanism to house. The things that had survived the mountain and the siege and could be carried forward. The things that couldn't.\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" he said, without looking up. The words came out heavier than he'd perhaps intended, landing on the stone floor of the smithy like something dropped. \"Not because I can't scrape up gear in Millbrook. I could. There's a metalworker on the east lane who does passable work, and I've made do with less.\"\n\nHe picked up the dragon-dwarf chisel—the one from his grandfather's maps, the one that had started all of this—and turned it in his hands. The etchings on the shaft were worn to suggestion, barely readable, the kind of thing you had to know was there to see.\n\n\"I'm leaving because I have to stand in front of my clan and say my grandfather wasn't mad. He was right.\" He set the chisel down and began wrapping it in oilcloth, slowly, with the care of someone performing a small ceremony. \"His journals, his maps, the chisel—if I don't put them in Deepstone hands myself, he stays a punchline and my name goes with him. That matters where I come from. It matters to me.\"\n\nCaelin watched him wrap the chisel. He thought about the mountain, about the vault that had opened for Thornik's key and no one else's. He thought about what it meant to have been right about something for thirty years with no one believing you.\n\n\"I'll retool at home,\" Thornik continued. \"Proper charges, lenses that don't crack when you look at them sideways, a housing that doesn't rattle. But that's not the reason. The reason is ancestry. And truth.\"\n\n\n\nHe turned to each of them in turn, and this part he'd clearly thought about.\n\nTo Vex, he held out a slim leather case, small enough to disappear into a palm. She opened it: three smoke-sticks, the kind that went off on impact and made it hard to see anything for thirty seconds. \"Disappearing, not winning,\" he said. \"Don't be clever with them. Just go.\"\n\n\"You've met me,\" Vex said.\n\n\"That's why I only gave you three.\"\n\nShe tucked them away.\n\nTo Caelin, an iron ring the width of a thumb, one quadrant filed to a gap. \"At dusk on Sixthday, tap three-one-two on any stone. If I'm above ground and within a week's march, it'll hum toward me.\" He pressed it into Caelin's palm. \"Don't lose it. I only made two and the other one's mine.\"\n\nTo Serana, last, a gear-coin stamped with the Deepstone mark—a small bronze disc the size of a knuckle. \"If I go quiet too long, show this at any Deepstone hall. They'll know how to find me.\" He held her gaze. \"I'm not planning to go quiet.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"I hate leaving you,\" he finished, and his voice went rough at the edges in the way of people who don't usually let it. \"But if I stay, I'm another body with the wrong tools. If I go, I come back with the right kit and proof that my grandfather's name means something. And he stops laughing alone.\"\n\nVex tucked the smoke-case into her jacket. \"Try not to die of politics.\"\n\n\"No promises,\" he said, and almost smiled. \"You know how clans are.\"\n\n\n\nIV. Serana's Road\n\n\n\nThey found her by the half-fallen chapel arch, alone. The chapel had taken smoke damage on the south wall; one window was gone, and the pale morning light came through the gap in a way that made the remaining stone look older than it was. She stood with her fingers resting on the arch, not in prayer—she'd have been the first to say so—but in the way of someone reading a language they used to be fluent in and were not sure they still spoke.\n\nShe heard them approach and didn't turn.\n\n\"I've been trying to find a way to say this that isn't a failure,\" she said. \"I haven't found one. So I'll just say it.\"\n\nShe turned then. Her face was composed—the particular composure of someone who'd made a decision and was standing behind it, not because it was easy but because it was the only honest thing left.\n\n\"My light failed,\" she said. \"You've seen it. It may return—I don't know—but right now I can't pray with any certainty that someone is listening. And I can't lead you while I don't know whose voice I'm following, if any. That would be dishonest. And dishonest faith is worse than no faith at all—it gets people killed on promises you can't keep.\"\n\nThe silence after that was the kind that asks not to be filled quickly.\n\nCaelin was the one who finally spoke. \"Where will you go?\"\n\n\"East. There's a place—an old house of retreat, not affiliated with any order—where they take people who are having difficulty with questions like mine.\" A pause. \"People who have lost the signal and are trying to find it again. Or learning to live without it.\" She looked at the gap in the chapel wall. \"I don't know which of those I'm doing yet.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"I don't know that either.\"\n\n\n\nShe unrolled a strip of plain linen inked with a knotwork sigil—old work, careful, the lines laid down with a steady hand. \"A vigil-knot. No goddess required—just breath and intention. Tie it round a wrist, speak the count of nine slowly, and it holds a line against panic for about an hour. Not much.\" She almost smiled. \"Enough, sometimes.\"\n\nShe pressed one into Caelin's hand, then set three more on the stone ledge of the arch. \"For whoever needs them. They'll keep.\"\n\n\"If I'm meant to come back, I will,\" she said. \"And if not—\" her eyes moved to each of them in turn, settling last on Caelin \"—you already know how to stand. You've been doing it since the mountain. You just didn't notice because I was nearby.\"\n\nVex had been quiet the whole time, which was unusual enough to notice. She unfolded her arms—carefully, because of the rib—and said: \"If your god is taking interviews, tell Her the customer service is abysmal.\"\n\nThe ghost of a smile crossed Serana's face—real, not performed. \"I'll pass it along.\"\n\nShe picked up her pack. It was lighter than it had been. She'd left the heavy things behind.\n\n\n\nV. The Mile-Stone\n\n\n\nThey met at the mile-stone where the road forked into three good choices and a dozen bad ones. The stone had names carved into it, most worn past reading—travellers who'd wanted to leave something behind at a crossing. Woodsmoke rode the evening air from the town, thinner now, dying down to its ordinary register.\n\n\"Three roads,\" Vex said. \"How poetic.\"\n\nNo one contradicted her.\n\nThornik had his pack on his back and his grandfather's chisel wrapped and stowed and his tool-harness sitting lighter than it had in months—not because it was empty but because what remained in it was what he'd chosen to keep. He looked north toward the mountains and then back at the group with the expression of a man who has made his decision and is waiting to see how it feels to live with it.\n\n\"Three roads,\" Serana answered, thumb working the edge of the gear-coin Thornik had given her. \"I don't know when mine turns back toward yours.\"\n\n\"With luck,\" Thornik said, and he tapped Caelin's tone-ring against the stone—three-one-two, a sound like a small careful knock—\"mine will rejoin before Depthspire. If not, the ring knows the way.\"\n\nCaelin pressed the ring between his fingers and felt the gap where the quadrant was missing. He thought about what it meant that Thornik had kept the matching one. He tightened the dark ribbon under his sleeve and said: \"We don't wait at doors we can't close. If we have to go in, we go in.\"\n\n\"And we find each other if we can,\" Serana said.\n\nThey stood at the stone for a moment longer than was strictly necessary. Nobody was in a rush to be the first to walk away. The light was going copper at the edges and the wind had come up from the northwest, carrying the smell of distance—cold grass, bare earth, the particular nothing-smell of a road that goes somewhere you haven't been.\n\nThey didn't hug. They weren't that kind of story yet. But they stood close enough that if any one of them had stumbled in that moment, the others would have caught them without thinking.\n\nThornik turned toward the northern road, the mountains catching the first cold stars. Serana took the eastward track, where old pilgrim stones lined the ditch like teeth worn to stubs. Caelin, Vex, and Durgan faced the merchant way.\n\nThe wind shifted. Iron-sweet from the ruined gate. Last hearth-smoke from a town that had held as long as it could. Somewhere far below stone, the Depthspire pulse came through the soles of their boots: Thud. Thud. Thud. Patient as geology. Counting.\n\nThey walked into their separate futures.\n\n\n\nAldric was waiting at the first bend in the road, medical bag over one shoulder, already facing north. He didn't say anything when they reached him. He fell into step at the back of the group, and that was that.",

The palisade gate stood propped with a beam Thornik had reset the night before—his last job in the town—and it creaked in the morning chill, wood resin sharp in the air.\n\nThe farewells were already done. They'd happened at a mile-stone a mile back, where the road forked three ways and people they trusted had taken two of the other turnings. What remained was just four shadows crossing frost-stiff grass, heading northeast.\n\nCaelin set an easy pace. The Ember's coal-glow tucked beneath a fresh wrap. The ribbon Nyxara had knotted at his wrist lay soft and cool against skin, its silver thread no darker than yesterday. He didn't tug at it. He resisted the urge to.\n\n\"Your stride's heavier,\" Vex said eventually, mismatched eyes flicking to his arm and away again. She was moving carefully herself—her ribs logged every twist of the torso, and she'd learned to stop twisting.\n\n\"Hurts more in the cold,\" Caelin admitted. \"It'll level out.\"\n\nDurgan walked rear guard, winter-pale and deliberate. He scanned the hedgerows and the ditch lines, not the road. When he stepped, his shadow stepped with him—with an effort most people wouldn't have noticed, but Vex did. She pretended not to.\n\nAldric walked between Durgan and the rest, which seemed to be where he'd decided he fit. He carried his medical bag slung across one shoulder and moved with the unhurried economy of a man who'd learned to conserve what he had a long time ago. He hadn't said anything since the mile-stone bend. He didn't appear to need to.\n\n\n\nBy the time the road bent past the last shepherd's croft, the smells had changed from dung smoke and malt to iron-rich streamwater and thawed loam. A farmer had nailed a square of parchment to a boundary post. Wind worried its corners.\n\nVex plucked it free, skimmed, snorted. \"You're famous.\"\n\nCaelin didn't need the illustration to know. The crude sketch got the angles of his face wrong but captured the impossible: a black mark in a man's forearm.\n\n\"Alive,\" Vex read. \"One thousand gold. More for the mark intact.\"\n\n\"Price is climbing,\" Durgan said, voice flat.\n\n\"Means we're interesting,\" Vex replied. \"Hate that.\"\n\nAldric leaned over and read the poster without taking it from Vex. \"The illustration's generous. You've got better cheekbones than that.\" He walked on. \"Also a thousand gold is insultingly low for whatever that thing in your arm actually is. Someone's being stingy.\"\n\nThey left the sign flapping on its nail. Crows watched from a hedge, heads cocked.\n\n\n\nTwo miles on, at a wayside shrine toppled by frost heave, Caelin dropped to a knee to tighten his boot. When he cinched the lace and reached for his pack, his fingers brushed paper that hadn't been there when they left town.\n\nHe froze. Then palmed it out.\n\nCream stock. No seal. Three words in an elegant hand that shifted colors in the light like oil on water:\n\nNorth by iron. Two days' grace. —L\n\nA prismatic dusting ran across the letters and vanished.\n\nVex caught the flick of paper. \"Problem?\"\n\n\"Map note,\" Caelin said, folding it into his sleeve. Not a lie. Not the truth.\n\nShe eyed him a beat longer than was comfortable, then nodded once. \"Good. We could use a map.\"\n\nThey rose and walked. The road narrowed to a wheel-track pressed between thorn and alder. Somewhere upslope, a hawk cried. The sky was pale, brittle, clean.",

                "text": "Act II: The Hedge and the Hounds\n\n\n\nThey cut off the road at noon to skirt a flooded bend and followed a sheep path along a hedgerow prickled with last year's hawthorn. Water ran high in the ditch—brown and cold, tea-bitter with tannin. The air smelled of wet wool, iron, and green things just remembering how to live.\n\nVex stopped so abruptly Caelin nearly walked into her. One gloved hand angled down: halt.\n\nShe'd seen it: a drag across the ditch slime where something heavy had been pulled, reeds crushed in a neat human pattern. On the hedge's far side, the faintest glint of brass where no brass should be.\n\n\"Trip-line,\" she breathed. \"Caltrops behind it.\"\n\nFrom the hedge ahead, a voice with too much bravado and not enough patience: \"Easy now. Hands up, no tricks.\"\n\nThree men broke the hedge at once—two with crossbows, one with a short fowling spear. They wore leather jacks with mismatched studs and the expressions of people who hadn't been paid yet.\n\n\"Don't,\" Vex said to Caelin without looking. \"You'll break yourself on farmers.\"\n\n\"Bounty's for alive,\" the spear carrier said, eyes on Caelin. \"We're not monsters.\"\n\nBehind Caelin, something thinned in the light. Vex didn't turn, but she felt it: Durgan's shadow flattening like a hound belly-crawling before a pounce.\n\n\"Crossbows down,\" Caelin said, keeping his voice level. \"And we'll talk.\"\n\nOne of the men smiled. It was not a good smile. \"Talking's extra.\"\n\nVex moved. Not the dramatic leap of a stage knife but a hunter's step—heel-to-ball, weight forward. A flick of wrist and the spearman's weapon wasn't in his hand anymore; it was in the ditch with a splash, and he was bleeding from the web of skin between thumb and forefinger in a way that made him as angry as it did clumsy.\n\nBoth crossbows thunked.\n\nCaelin didn't dodge.\n\nHeat spiked up the lattice in his arm—fast, focused, controlled. He punched his palm at the ground between them, not at the men. Air went hard in a fan and the ditchwater hissed—stone to glass in a strip three feet wide. The bolts hit the newborn slick and skated sideways into the hedge, thunk-thunk, harmless.\n\nThe pain arrived half a beat later. Not rupturing. Not yet. A white wire drawn through the filaments, singing in his teeth.\n\n\"Last chance,\" Caelin said, breath thin. \"Go home.\"\n\nThey didn't. The second crossbowman yelped something about \"hazard pay\" and crabbed sideways to get a shot. Durgan's blade touched his throat from behind before he finished the motion.\n\n\"Drop it,\" Durgan said. Calm. Too calm.\n\nThe man dropped it. The bowstring twanged and sang a sad little note as it hit the glass strip and spun.\n\nThe spear carrier dove for his weapon in the ditch, came up with cold mud and a broken glove. Vex met him halfway—rib to elbow, knee to thigh, heel to instep—a conversation he lost quickly and with regret.\n\nThe last one bolted.\n\nVex let him run. \"Tell your employer,\" she called, \"to upgrade the talent.\"\n\nShe retrieved the dropped spear and snapped it over her knee just because it felt good. The rib reminded her immediately that it had opinions about that. She absorbed the flash of pain without showing it, mostly.\n\nDurgan released the man he'd collared—gently, considering—and stepped back like he'd touched a stove. His nose was bleeding. He wiped it onto black cloth that wouldn't show it.\n\nCaelin exhaled, shakier than he wanted to be. The filaments along his forearm thrummed angrily then settled to their baseline ache—manageable. For now.\n\n\"What was that with the ground?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Glass,\" Caelin said, flexing his hand. \"Easier to slide on than stand on.\"\n\n\"Going to assume you can only do that a handful of times before you chew your arm off.\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nShe nodded, cataloguing his limits the way she catalogued everything. \"Noted.\"\n\n\n\nThey crossed the ditch at a dry spot Vex found upstream and cut through a copse of alder that smelled of cat-pee and river iron. The day leaned toward afternoon; clouds stacked to the west in slate wedges.\n\nThey found an abandoned charcoal clamp on the lee side of a low hill and took ten minutes to drink and breathe. Caelin's arm cooled to a sulk. Durgan watched his own shadow not move. Vex used a shard of Caelin's glass to trim a hanging thread from her sleeve with a surgeon's care.\n\nAldric set down his bag and looked at Vex. \"Rib.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\n\"You winced when you broke that spear. Sit down.\"\n\n\"I said—\"\n\n\"I know what you said.\" He was already opening the bag. \"Sit down.\"\n\nShe sat. He ran two fingers along the rib line with clinical detachment, found the break by her sharp intake of breath, and pronounced it the same as before—cracked, not displaced, nothing to do but strap it and stop doing stupid things with it. She didn't comment on the last part. He didn't expect her to.\n\nHe checked Caelin's arm wrap while he was at it—didn't touch the scale, just the bandaging. \"Holding,\" he said, in the tone of a man noting a weather gauge. Then he packed his bag and stood. \"Forest ahead?\"\n\n\"Ironwood fringe by nightfall,\" Vex said. \"If we keep moving.\"\n\n\"Stick to the hedge lines,\" Caelin said. \"Off the road the rest of the day.\"\n\nThey rose and moved on—quicker now, quieter. The hedgerows thinned to fern and dogrose. Crows followed at a polite distance.",

A forgotten road—older than any of them had a right to name—cut through in a shallow camber, the stones slick with moss and time.\n\nAt a crossroads of ruts and intention, a waystone stood hip-high—granite freckled with lichen, nine faint sigils carved around its crown. Most folks would see old scratches. Caelin's scale saw a circuit.\n\nThe Ember warmed. Not hot. Not warning. Recognition.\n\nVex crouched and brushed dirt from the base, revealing a dwarf-stamp so worn it was almost a rumor. \"Thornik would've loved this,\" she said, softer than she meant to.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Caelin said.\n\nHe dug into his pocket and found Serana's ward-disc—the little bronze coin stamped with a sunburst she'd pressed into his hand without a prayer. He set it on the waystone's flat top.\n\nFor a heartbeat, the disc's lines flared dull gold, as if something in the stone remembered what warding felt like. A faint smell of struck flint lifted and was gone.\n\n\"Still works,\" Vex said. \"A little.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Caelin said.\n\nThey ate cold trail-bread and harder cheese. Durgan drifted the perimeter like a boundary rider, never far, never comfortably close, the way a man walks when he doesn't trust the ground he's standing on.\n\nA moth the size of a thumb fluttered into the ward's slight radius and settled on the waystone. It fanned powdery wings, paused as if listening, then lifted into the dark. Somewhere far away, a fox barked twice.\n\nCaelin unrolled his bedroll beneath a blackthorn and only then checked his pack again. The cream note was gone. In its place, a strip of vellum narrower than a finger, rolled tight and tied with a thread that wasn't a color he could name.\n\nHe didn't open it.\n\nThe ribbon at his wrist lay quiet and cool. He resisted the itch to touch it.\n\n\n\nLater, when the forest had stilled to the sounds ironwoods make—sap whisper and the tiny crackle of frost forming—he woke to a light on the northern horizon that wasn't the moon.\n\nA curtain of green-white shimmered and folded on itself like silk lit from within, then tore and sealed without sound. The hairs on his forearms rose; the scale's lattice hummed to a pitch he could feel in his teeth.\n\n\"Wake,\" he said, already on one knee.\n\nVex sat up instantly, dagger half-drawn. Durgan turned his face north and didn't blink.\n\n\"What is that?\" Vex whispered.\n\n\"Depthspire,\" Caelin said, certain without knowing how. \"Something opened. Or closed.\"\n\n\"Doors,\" Durgan said. \"You can hear them even when you can't.\"\n\nFrom the far side of the waystone, Aldric sat up from his bedroll and looked north. He said nothing for a long moment. The aurora folded and refolded, silent and wrong.\n\n\"I've seen that light once before,\" he said finally. \"Two years ago, three weeks before Veln's Post.\" His voice was even—not steady the way a calm man is steady, but steady the way a man is steady who has decided what he thinks about something and is done renegotiating. \"It wasn't a warning. It was a door opening. And thirty-seven men died to whatever came through.\"\n\nNo one answered that. It didn't need an answer.\n\nThe light faded by degrees until the horizon was only horizon again, and the ironwoods went on pretending to be ordinary trees.\n\n\"Two days' grace,\" Caelin said under his breath, thinking of prismatic dust and steady hands. He didn't explain it.\n\nVex didn't ask.\n\n\"Forest track or Merchant Road?\" she asked instead.\n\n\"Forest,\" Caelin said. \"Humans on the road. Scouts hate ironwood.\"\n\n\"Scouts hate wards,\" Durgan added, nodding at the disc still warm with a memory of light.\n\n\"Then forest,\" Vex decided. \"We thread the old way.\"\n\n\n\nThey settled again to the kind of rest you take in pieces. Vex lay on her good shoulder and counted breaths until numbers didn't matter. Durgan watched his shadow not move and let the dark drink what it needed. Caelin held the unopened vellum and didn't open it.\n\nAldric sat with his back against the waystone, eyes open, doing the particular mathematics of a man who'd been told a door was opening and was calculating what might come through it. After a while he lay down, not because he thought he'd sleep, but because horizontal was better than the alternative.\n\nThe ironwoods creaked softly, like doors deciding when to be doors.\n\nAt some point, far to the north, something knocked once. Not loud. Not near.\n\nA patient sound.\n\nCounting.",

The air lost its tang of cold iron and sap; warm earth came up instead—mud, wet moss, the faint yeasty breath of leaf-rot. Caelin walked center, the witch-knot ribbon Nyxara had tied at his wrist dull as old wine in the daylight. Every so often it ticked with the gentlest tug, as if a spider had plucked a single strand of web and let it sing. Not a direction—just a proof of distance, of attention. Someone, somewhere, still watching.\n\nVex ranged left, favoring her wrapped ribs but moving like a rumor. Durgan took the right, ice-blue eyes on the tree line, shadow obedient as a good dog at noon. Aldric walked rear—medical bag across one shoulder, eyes moving between the road ahead and the tree line Durgan was watching, doing his own quiet accounting of threats.\n\nThe world smelled almost domestic for the first time since the mountain—woodsmoke drift from somewhere far downslope; a farm's latrine, honest and rank. Civilization as scent.\n\nThey hit the ruts of the old Merchant Road by noon—two pale crescents pressed into clay, puddles winking with sky. Ahead, a broken cart tilted against a ditch. A kettle still hung from its hook, long gone cold. Chicken feathers lay stuck to sap on a fallen branch. Someone had left in a hurry.\n\n\"Tracks,\" Vex said, crouching. \"Two families. One cartwheel cracked, they ditched it. Southbound—same as us.\" She sniffed the air, a feral, automatic habit. \"Yesterday, maybe sunrise.\"\n\nThe ribbon on Caelin's wrist gave that whisper-tug again. He didn't look at it. He touched the bronzed ward-disc Serana had pressed into his palm when she left—the surface etched with a line of secular intention, protective not because a god blessed it, but because a stubborn woman had. The metal held a little warmth. It steadied him more than he liked admitting.\n\n\"Company,\" Durgan murmured.\n\n\n\nThey saw the woman first—a farmer, hair gone wild, dress torn at the hem, one arm around a boy not more than seven and the other around a bundle that might have been bread or a baby. She stood in the road's center, frozen like a doe, staring at the black smear moving along the ditch shadow—a scout's shade, thin as spilled ink.\n\nThe thing reached for the boy's feet.\n\nDurgan moved.\n\nHe didn't think. He went. One clean sprint that ate the distance, one boot heel that slammed the shadow flat against bright clay, and then the soldier's rhythm took over—draw, slash, step; blade in a short arc that cut where light and ground met, the place shadows anchor. The shade recoiled, hissing without a mouth, and shivered itself thin to slither away.\n\nDurgan planted a second cut that pinned it like a nail through silk. \"Run,\" he told the woman without looking back. \"Don't stop until you see a palisade.\"\n\nShe didn't argue. The boy stared at Durgan's face like he'd never seen a man before; then he was swept down the road by his mother's panic.\n\n\"Check the boy for shock when you stop!\" Aldric called after them. \"He'll be quiet—that's the wrong kind of quiet!\" He watched them go, then looked at the smear on the road where the shade had been. \"That's different from what came through the vault.\" He said it without emphasis, matter-of-fact. \"The Veln's Post thing was bigger. Older. This is a forward scout.\"\n\nVex's eyes flicked to Durgan when it was done. Approval was not her currency, but it showed anyway, quick as light on a blade.\n\nCaelin exhaled a breath he hadn't known he held. The scale in his forearm said nothing—no sting, no warning. The world smelled of crushed grass and the metallic, coin-thin scent the shade had left behind.\n\nDurgan's nose was dry when he wiped it with the back of his hand. He checked anyway. Habit. Waiting.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Caelin said.\n\nDurgan sheathed his blade. \"Keep moving.\"\n\nThey did.",

Four horses stood side by side, heads down, lather drying white on their necks. A rope-drag of dead brush spanned the road, glistening with black pitch. Six men in leather and scale waited behind it, crossbows already braced on the rocks. One wore a red kerchief at his throat; one had the lazy stance of someone who'd killed often enough to be bored by it.\n\n\"Afternoon,\" the bored one said. \"You match a description.\"\n\nVex's mouth twitched. \"Let me guess. 'Tall, cursed, and bad at avoiding trouble.'\"\n\n\"Something like that.\" The bored man's gaze never left Caelin's arm. \"Bounty says alive. Your friends may sulk off or not. Choice is a luxury but I'm magnanimous.\"\n\nAldric, standing at the back of the group, set his medical bag down on the road with the quiet deliberateness of a man who has been in enough of these situations to know that the bag stays where it can be reached quickly. He folded his hands and said nothing. He was not going to sulk off.\n\nCaelin's scale warmed. Not a flare; a gathering. He counted breaths, counted costs. The pitch-brush smelled like shipyards and siege ladders. Tar's flash point lived in his hands if he asked for it.\n\n\"Crossbow pivots,\" Vex murmured from the corner of her mouth. \"Two right, one left, leader center. Drop center, I delete right. You still standing?\"\n\n\"Standing,\" Caelin said. He flexed his hand. The lattice tugged back, a warning twine, but his body had learned new shapes for pain.\n\nDurgan's voice stayed flat. \"Last chance. Walk away.\"\n\nThe red-kerchief man smiled with his eyes. \"No.\"\n\nTime folded.\n\nVex moved first. A silver line crossed sunlight—her throwing knife—and the central bowman jerked as if a wasp stung his eye, then folded to the dust.\n\nCaelin breathed in. Heat gathered behind his ribs the way a forge gathers rightness; he pictured not fire but temperature, a widow's kiss that rushed through air without flame. His palm lifted. The pitch line sighed, then whoomph—tar flared in a low, fast curtain. Black smoke stamped the sky. The barricade twisted and fell.\n\nBolts sang toward them anyway—two, three. One hissed past Caelin's ear. One struck stone and cracked like a promise. One took Durgan's sleeve and left a slice of red without slowing him. He was already in their faces, blades walking the short economy of a soldier trained for close work. Two men went down with groans that would fade or not; he left them breathing on purpose.\n\nPain pealed through Caelin's arm—more bell than blade. He took it. Let it ring his bones. He dropped to one knee and pulled air through his teeth, felt the lattice complain, then settle into the old, ugly baseline.\n\nVex hit the right-hand pair like consequence. First man's wrist—snapped; second's kneecap—cut; she drove her pommel into a temple and let him sleep out his poor choices. The last bounty hunter—the bored one—dropped his crossbow, raised his hands, and smiled again with nothing to smile about.\n\n\"Mercy?\" he said.\n\nDurgan's knife was at his throat. \"You'll leave a message.\"\n\n\"Ah. To whom?\"\n\n\"Whoever pays you. Tell them you saw the fire and lived. Tell them next time you won't.\"\n\nThe man swallowed, his Adam's apple pushing the blade. \"I can do polite.\"\n\n\"Do it farther away.\" Durgan stepped back. The shadow under his boots stayed ordinary in the full hammer of noon.\n\n\n\nThey dragged the pitch brush off the road with their boots. The world was tar reek and burned horsehair and the sour tang of someone's fear-sweat.\n\nAldric went straight to Durgan. \"Sleeve up.\"\n\n\"It's a scratch.\"\n\n\"Sleeve up.\"\n\nDurgan pushed up the sleeve. The bolt had opened a four-inch line across the forearm—clean, not deep. Aldric cleaned it with something from a small flask that smelled medicinal and unpleasant, bound it with three quick turns of linen, and tied it off without ceremony. \"Keep it dry. It won't.\" He looked at Caelin on one knee. \"How's the arm?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.\"\n\n\"It's the answer I have.\"\n\nAldric looked at him for a moment with the expression of a man who'd heard that particular response in that particular tone before, from men who were about to find out it wasn't enough. He let it go. For now.\n\nVex wiped her knife on a patch of clean grass and cocked a brow at Caelin. \"How many of those,\" she said, nodding at the blackened barricade, \"before you fall down and I have to carry you?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Caelin admitted. \"Fewer than we'd like. More than yesterday.\"\n\n\"Progress,\" she said, and almost smiled.\n\nDurgan wiped his sleeve. No blood on his hand this time. He exhaled once, like a man setting a weight down where no one would notice.\n\nThey took the horses nobody wanted to keep and rode until the light went copper.",

A basalt bridge arched the gap in a single impossible span, black as a raven's back, edges beveled to a craftsman's vanity. Wind lived down there. It smelled of cold stone and something old and salty, though the sea lay weeks away.\n\nAt the near end of the bridge, someone had carved a sigil into a waist-high stone: a circle doubled back on itself, nine spokes, the tenth line severed. Thornik would have told them the lineage of the chisel marks. In his absence, Caelin only felt seen. The scale warmed, shyly. Vex touched the symbol with two fingers and let the gesture be a greeting.\n\nHalfway across, the light changed.\n\nNot dimmer—stranger. The sun still bled out across the world, but the space over the span held a second dusk of its own, a hush laid over air. Caelin tasted metal on his tongue. The ribbon at his wrist gave a single bright pluck, like a harpstring in a room with no hands.\n\nWords raised from the stone, not carved but standing—letters the eye only loved if it looked from the side.\n\nSpeak true or speak not at all.\n\nVex stopped dead. \"I hate bridges that talk.\"\n\n\"It's a ward,\" Caelin said. He took out Serana's disc. The secular line etched into bronze caught the odd light and answered in a soft, stubborn glow. The sense of it wasn't holy, not anymore. It was made strong by work. By intention. I will keep what I can.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"We are crossing to the plateau. We intend to harm no one who does not try to harm us. We seek a prison that isn't a prison.\" He paused. Laughed once at himself. \"We're in over our heads.\"\n\nThe bridge listened. Said nothing. But the pressure eased enough to breathe.\n\n\"Fine,\" Vex said, and stepped into the ward's hush. She could have lied to it with panache. She chose not to. \"I am very tired,\" she informed the air. \"I am very hungry. I do not want to die before I stab whoever designed this road.\"\n\nThe hush let her pass.\n\nDurgan hesitated a fraction. His shadow bled one inch toward the parapet, stopped as if it had hit glass, and recoiled like a burned animal. The smell of singed wool flicked the air then died, leaving the clean ache of wind.\n\n\"I will not hurt them,\" he said to no one and everyone. \"Not while I am me.\"\n\nThe ward accepted that as truth.\n\nAldric stepped up to the ward's edge and stood there a moment with his hands at his sides. He didn't look like a man performing sincerity. He looked like a man who'd decided what was true and was simply reporting it.\n\n\"I came to find out what killed thirty-seven men,\" he said. \"And if there's anything left to do about it.\"\n\nThe hush considered this and let him through.\n\n\n\nThey stood at the bridge's crown and looked north. The world beyond rolled away in bruised gold: scrub, broken stone, low thorn. And there, like a nail driven into the horizon, lay a black plateau shouldering out of the world—the Depthspire rise, not yet the thing itself, but the country of it. Above, a pale aurora wrote thin curtains across the sky where no such lights should run.\n\nA square of folded paper fell out of Caelin's pack and landed against his boot.\n\nVex's hand hit a dagger before he'd bent to pick it up. Durgan's blades whispered half-free and went still when nothing moved to justify it.\n\nThe note was ordinary to the point of insolence—cheap stock, black ink, a smell of old lavender as if it had slept too long in an honest drawer.\n\nCaelin opened it.\n\nYour pace is sufficient. Keep the road's left edge when the basalt goes to clay; the right is mined by men who will not remember why they laid the charges. I will not wait long at the first watch-tower. —L\n\nVex made a face that belonged to someone who'd bitten a green apple. \"Divination and manners,\" she said. \"Pick one.\"\n\nCaelin folded the note, slid it away. \"He's ahead of us.\"\n\n\"Or behind and being clever about it.\" Vex shaded her eyes against a wind that didn't need shading. \"Either way, I vote we don't sleep on the bridge.\"\n\nAldric looked at the note Caelin had pocketed, then at the plateau on the horizon, then said nothing. He'd stopped asking who L was. The answer was somewhere north of them and he'd find out when they got there.\n\n\n\nThey finished the span, and the hush let them go. On the far side, someone had piled three stones into a cairn you'd miss if you blinked. Caelin set Serana's disc on the top for a breath, warmed it with the heat the scale made when it was patient, and took it back. The night smelled of sage crushed under boots and basalt cooling after day.\n\nThey made camp in the lee of a boulder where the wind could sing without tearing the blankets loose. The ribbon at Caelin's wrist lay quiet. The ward-disc held its stubborn warmth. Durgan set himself where he could see both the bridge and their fire; when his nose bled, he turned his head and let the dark drink it. Aldric sat with his back to the boulder and his bag between his feet and looked north, doing whatever arithmetic he'd been doing since Veln's Post and not sharing the result.\n\nSleep came as a courtesy, not a gift.",

                "text": "Epilogue\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe slab fell.\n\nWhat came after was dark and cold and the kind of silence that exists deep inside stone—not empty, but occupied, the way old places are occupied by the weight of their own age. The grinding had stopped. Dust still moved in the air. It would move for a long time.\n\nThe root-web was gone. Every thread of it—spent, not broken, burned from green to white to nothing in the last three seconds before impact. The tattoos along her arms were pale, almost colorless in the dark. The magic that had given her new language for the past weeks had emptied itself out completely. She could feel the absence where it had been. Like a room she'd lived in that now held only the outline of furniture.\n\nShe was alive.\n\nThat was—that was unexpected.\n\nShe took a slow inventory, the way her circle had taught her: start at the feet, move up, report honestly. Left ankle — wrong, grinding, don't move it. Ribs — several. A warmth at her temple that would be blood. The staff was gone; she could feel that the way you feel a lost tooth — not just absence but the shape of absence. Everything hurt, which was fine. Everything hurting meant nerves reporting from a body that was still present.\n\nThe dark was absolute. She had no light, no fire, no silver-borrowed glow. The vine-ink along her arms gave nothing.\n\nBut something else did.\n\nIt was faint — thin as a thread pulled through the eye of a needle from a great distance. Not her magic. Not anything she'd called or shaped. It came from below her, from the roots of the mountain itself, from systems so old they predated the Concord's seals by centuries. Mountain oak. Ancient alder. The deep network that connected living things through stone and loam and the slow patience of trees.\n\nIt had caught her.\n\nNot gently. Not carefully. The way a root catches a thing rolling toward a cliff edge — at the last possible moment, with no concern for comfort. She was wedged against a natural shelf of stone she hadn't landed on so much as been deposited on, bruised and broken in the way of things that fall a long way and survive it. The root structure around her was faintly warm. Not warm like fire. Warm like something alive.\n\nShe didn't know if it knew she was there. She didn't know if it had chosen her or simply intercepted her the way a river intercepts rain.\n\nShe lay still and breathed and let the thin warmth of it be the only thing that mattered.\n\nAbove her, far above, Caelin had said her name to a sealed scar of stone that did not care.\n\nBelow her, the mountain went on doing whatever mountains do in the dark, in the deep, in the patient counting silence, long after the people on its surface had stopped paying attention.\n\nShe was alive.\n\nFor now, that was enough.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe wards had been failing for two years.\n\nNot dramatically—not in the way of things collapsing or breaking or announcing themselves with noise. Slowly, the way ice fails in the first days of a warm season: a hairline at the margin, then another, then a slow creep toward center that goes unnoticed until the whole surface is laced with fractures and one footstep is all it takes.\n\nThe prisoners on the upper levels had felt it first. They always would—they were closest to the surface, closest to the light they'd been sealed away from. The shadow-things that had come to Millbrook were only the outermost layer of what Depthspire held: scouts, explorers, the opportunistic edge of a population that had been confined for a generation and was learning, by degrees, that the walls were not what they used to be.\n\nDeeper, the older things waited with older patience.\n\nThe Concord had built Depthspire as a system. Each level harder than the last. Each prisoner more dangerous than the one above, positioned as both inmate and deterrent—the logic being that anything trying to reach the vault at the bottom would have to pass through layer after layer of something that very much did not want to be passed through. It had worked, for a while. It had worked for eighty years.\n\nBut the Nine relics were waking. Not all at once, not at the same rate, but in the way of interconnected things when one begins to resonate—the others follow. The binding magic threaded through Depthspire's architecture was tuned to a stillness that no longer existed. Every relic that came alive was another string plucked in a net designed for silence. And the creatures in the deep levels could feel each one.\n\nOn the third level, something with too many joints pressed itself against a ward-wall that had developed a soft spot the size of a palm. It pressed, and the wall gave a little, and it pressed again. It had been pressing for six weeks. It was not in a hurry.\n\nOn the fifth level, in a chamber the original architects had flooded as a secondary measure, something moved through the water in slow circles. The flood had been receding for eighteen months as the drainage seals cracked. There was less water than there had been. There would be less still. The thing in the water was adjusting to this with the pragmatism of something that had survived worse than a room running dry.\n\nAt the base—the real base, the level the Concord had built everything else above in order to contain it—there was no prisoner.\n\nThe Concord had not built Depthspire around a prisoner.\n\nThey had built it around something older than the Concord, older than the kingdom that had preceded it, older than the language the wards were written in. Something they had found already in the deep rock, already contained by methods they did not fully understand, already patient in its darkness in a way that suggested it had been patient for a very long time and had learned not to waste effort on urgency.\n\nThey had added their own seals to whatever had come before. Layers on layers. Very thorough. Very carefully done.\n\nThe seals were failing.\n\nNot the old ones—not yet. The old ones were different in kind from anything the Concord's engineers had built, and they were holding in the way of things built by people who understood what they were holding. But the Concord's layers, the careful human additions, the wards tuned to a silence that no longer existed—those were fracturing.\n\nBelow everything, in the dark that predated the structure above it, something that had been very still for a very long time made a sound.\n\nNot a word. Not a movement. Just a sound.\n\nPatient as geology.\n\nCounting.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThey walked north.\n\nThe plateau had been visible since morning—a black shelf of rock pushing up out of the horizon like something that had always been there and had simply been waiting for the angle to be right. The Depthspire rise. Not the structure itself, not yet, but the approach to it, the country of it, the air that had been breathing the same cold breath as whatever was sealed in the deep below.\n\nThe scale in Caelin's arm had been warm since they crossed the Boundary Bridge. Not warning-warm, not the red-orange of effort or pain. Just warm. Present. The way a compass needle is present when you stop arguing with it and let it point.\n\nAldric walked at the back and said nothing. He'd been doing the arithmetic for months. He was nearly at an answer.\n\nDurgan walked the right flank with his shadow flat and obedient at his boots and his eyes on the tree line and his jaw set in the way of a man who has decided to keep making the choice one day at a time and not ask himself how many days he has left.\n\nVex walked left, ribs strapped, shoulder working, her eyes already on the plateau with the professional attention of someone calculating entrances and sight lines and the distance between where they were and where the trouble would start.\n\nNo one spoke. The road was basalt now, the clay having given way an hour back exactly where L's note had said it would.\n\nThe scale pulled north.\n\nThe plateau waited.\n\nSomewhere below it, in the dark where the wards were fracturing and the old things were stirring and something older than all of it had made a sound — the counting continued.\n\nBook Two begins at the gate.",

His lungs remembered how to fill. The ache in his arm didn’t disappear, but it quieted, as if even the scale understood that something here predated its urgency.\n\nThen the scale of it arrived. Pillars like old oaks, an obsidian floor that held their torchlight and gave it back doubled. Nine alcoves ringed the walls, each one a different geometry of purpose. The ceiling arched into dark too high to read.\n\n“Saints and stone,” Thornik breathed, the words barely a sound.\n\nNobody told him to be quiet. The Hall already had that covered. There was a hum here—low, below hearing, felt in the soles of the feet rather than the ears—and it wasn’t welcoming exactly. It was the hum of something that had been here long before them and expected to be here long after. They were guests. The kind the house had been built to receive, but guests nonetheless.\n\nThey moved inward, and the dark closed behind them like water.\n\n\n\nDawn came thin and blue through the Deep Hall’s lichen glow, turning the carved pillars the color of frost-bitten iron. The air tasted clean here—cold stone, a thread of old forge-heat sleeping beneath it, and the faint chalk-dry tang of runes that still remembered their purpose.\n\nThey moved like people who had run out of adrenaline and were now running on decision.\n\nThornik was already at the central table, grandfather’s blood-marked journal pinned open under a gear clamp. Brass goggles perched on his forehead, he traced bas-reliefs with a smith’s reverent fingers: dwarves and dragons bent over the same anvil; nine pedestals lifted into place; an undefined chained shape ringed by wards.\n\n“Forge Road,” he murmured, beard-braid ticking against his lip as he measured spacings by thumb-width. “Here. Vent shafts run parallel to it—old draught chimneys for the caldera. If anything still breathes down here, it breathes along those lines.”\n\nSerana chalked a sigil on the stone just inside the threshold: nine quick strokes, intersecting arcs that looked wrong until they clicked into simple harmony. The chalk squeaked; the symbol caught the lichen-light and held it, no divine sheen, just stubborn geometry.\n\n“Secular ward,” she said when Caelin looked a question at her. “Old templar trick. No god required—only ratios and repetition.” She dusted her hands, leaving white on steel-callused palms. “It won’t stop a determined thing. But it notices what crosses.”\n\nElowen lowered herself beside the mark and pressed two fingers to the stone. The vine-ink along her arms pulsed a steady emerald with new threads of silver braided through—the Deep Hall’s abjurations still singing inside her since she’d touched the shields yesterday.\n\n“It listens back,” she said quietly. “Like a skin wound scabbing—the Weave remembers the shape of whole. These lines help it hold.” Her smile was small, an apology to the mountain. “For a time.”\n\nAcross the table, Caelin worked with his right hand open over a dented tin cup. The scale in his forearm sat at coal-glow, ember-motes drifting slow beneath obsidian like fireflies behind tinted glass. He called a tight needle of heat—less than a candle—and warmed the cup just enough to steam the water without boil. A second thread of focus: a bent pack-buckle on Serana’s strap, heat-softened, thumbed true, cooled with a breath.\n\nThe filaments under his skin tugged, then settled. Pain: there, but manageable. Like wearing boots a size too small and learning to walk anyway.\n\n“Keep the increments small, the cost small,” he said, mostly to himself. He tried a third exercise: a flat of cold ash on an iron pan, coaxed to lift in spirals, then allowed to fall in his open palm until it sketched Draconic for breathe in soot. The lattice stung once—needle-pain, warning accepted.\n\nNyxara watched, her expression the unreadable calm of someone who’d seen a hundred magics and kept score. The tips of her fingers were darker today, necrotic black like frostbite that had learned a language. She pulled her sleeves down without comment and leaned on the table as if the stone and its memory pleased her.\n\nDurgan stood with his back to a ribbed pillar, shadow lying neatly at his feet, hands loose, eyes far. He kept glancing to the chalk sigil at the threshold and then away, as if looking at a knife and deciding not to pick it up.\n\nVex was already moving, energy channeled into usefulness. She tested the Hall’s margins, checked for pressure plates that didn’t exist, and returned with three serviceable torches scavenged from niches high on the wall. “If the dwarves didn’t want anyone to touch a thing,” she said, “they carved it so beautifully you couldn’t help yourself. If they wanted you to live, they hid ventilation like it was contraband.” She sniffed. “Smoke goes somewhere. I approve.”\n\nThornik snorted. “Thank you. On behalf of my ancestors and basic fluid dynamics.”\n\nThey ate a cold breakfast: hard cheese that sweated fat in the chill, bread dense enough to patch a hole, dried fruit with the ghost of sweetness. The Deep Hall seemed to approve of quiet—it made their small noises clearer: the scrape of blade on stone as Serana honed an edge; the soft scuff of Elowen’s staff; Caelin’s measured breathing as he asked the Ember for one more small thing and paid for it with a pinprick of fire that didn’t quite become pain.",

If something needs unscrewing, you can talk to it.”\n\nThey took the eastern service corridor first—a low-ceilinged gallery, the stone so smooth it had forgotten it had ever been rough. The smell there was stranger: faint metal sweetness, like the air over a well-kept blade; a hum underfoot as if the rock carried a memory of current.\n\n“Residual load,” Thornik murmured, palm flat to the wall. “Conduction lines. The Hall leeches a steady trickle from micro-wards embedded in the bedrock. Old dwarven trick to keep structural fields topped.” He tapped the stone with a knuckle; the tone came back pure. “This gallery is stable.”\n\n“Good,” Vex said. “Next.”\n\nThe western spur choked almost immediately: a mining tunnel collapsed and then fused, as if heat had melted its failure into permanence. The smell was glass and dust. “Not our way,” Vex judged, crouching at the edge of a darkness that would not be argued with.\n\nThey returned to the threshold, to Serana’s chalk mark watching the doorway like a lidded eye.\n\n\n\nDurgan’s shadow moved first.\n\nIt slid a finger-length toward the sigil—not with the light’s logic, but with its own, pulled by something that didn’t care about angles or sources. The chalk lines brightened all at once, not gentle, not soft: a white-hot flare that hit the nose with scorched mineral and crisp ozone. The shadow recoiled in a visible ripple, as if fire had run through oil—fleeing back around Durgan’s boots, seething there until he crushed it flat with effort that made his jaw jump.\n\nNobody spoke.\n\nThe flare-light faded. The sigil settled back to its cold geometry. In the silence after, each of them found somewhere to look that wasn’t Durgan’s face—the pillar carvings, the floor, the chalk line itself still faintly warm. The kind of silence that isn’t absence of sound but absence of the right words.\n\nDurgan broke it. He wiped a single red thread from under his nostril with the back of his knuckle and looked at it as if surprised it existed. His jaw worked once, then settled.\n\n“It will again,” he said. “Keep the marks fresh.”\n\nSerana’s chin lifted a degree. “It noticed,” she said—not accusation, not pity. Accounting. She was already reaching for the chalk.\n\n\n\nElowen touched the stone near the burned-bright sigil without crossing it, palm flat. The silver threads in her tattoos shivered. “It hurt the wrongness without hating the person,” she said, a quiet relief in her voice. “I can feel the difference. We should lace the perimeter.”\n\n“On it,” Serana said, already pocketing the stump of chalk and breaking a fresh stick. “Corners and sightlines. Nine strokes each. We keep the geometry honest.”\n\nNyxara drifted parallel to Caelin as he cooled the buckle he’d mended. “Your restraint is very tiresome,” she observed, eyes on the faint steam. “Men half your age would already have tried to set the ceiling on fire to prove a point.”\n\n“I only just learned how much it costs,” Caelin said. He flexed his fingers, testing the lattice ache. “I can’t afford to show off.”\n\nNyxara’s smile acknowledged the answer and then filed it in a drawer marked useful. She tucked her sleeves lower. If anyone noticed the way she favored her hands, they had the courtesy not to say.\n\nThey ringed the Hall with chalk, nine-stroke sigils at each throat where a passage met the open space. The symbols gathered the lichen-light to themselves until the Deep Hall looked like a star-chart: pale constellations behind pillars and the slow, steady coal-glow of Caelin’s scale. The air tasted faintly of dusty limestone and hot flint.\n\nBy late afternoon they had a map.\n\n“Three viable routes,” Thornik said, tapping lines he’d sketched in charcoal on the central table. “Smithy run is flooded two at least two spans deep—I can hear it breathing. Mining spur is fused at the choke. That leaves us the Forge Road with a vent shaft network as auxiliary escape.”\n\n“Forge Road takes us toward the caldera?” Serana asked.\n\n“Aye. Past it. There’s a bridge and a long spiral stair to the east face. If it’s not collapsed.”\n\n“It’s not,” Elowen said, eyes half-closed as if feeling the mountain through the rock. “Stressed. Not broken. The Weave there is… tight. Like a rope under weight.”\n\n“Good enough,” Vex said. “We go at first light, when we’ve got the most in the tank.”\n\nNyxara looked back at the chalk wards tracing a new constellation around their camp. “First light it is. Assuming first light comes under a mountain.”\n\n“It does,” Thornik said. “It tastes different.”\n\n“Like what?” Vex asked.\n\n“Cold bread and old iron,” Thornik said, unhelpful and exactly right.",

Thornik leads with the map. Caelin center. Elowen behind him. Nyxara floats. We don’t stop unless we have to.”\n\n“Natural leadership,” Nyxara said. “Very stern. Do you ever enjoy hobbies?”\n\n“Sometimes I sharpen knives,” Serana said, and the tiny smile she didn’t mean to show made Nyxara’s eyes tick in amusement.\n\nVex rolled her shoulder and suppressed the flinch when pain shouted down her arm. The wound from Thornwick—stitched, scabbed, reopened, and restitched—complained like an old friend. “If anything moves in the spokes,” she said, “we don’t chase it.”\n\n“Second rules,” Thornik added. “Nobody kicks suspicious rocks, nobody licks mysterious crystals, and if a passage hums at a frequency that makes your molars hurt, you do not—under any circumstances—put your hand in it.”\n\nCaelin lifted an eyebrow. “You say that like it’s personal history.”\n\nThornik coughed. “My cousin. He no longer has eyebrows.”\n\nElowen’s gaze roved the pillars and their carved histories. She stopped at the Abjuration alcove, where bevel met bevel, each protecting the next. Her palm hovered over the stone and the silver threads under her skin gleamed once, like moonlight on a stream. “I can carry a little of this forward,” she said. “Not the strength of the Hall—but a memory of it. When it matters.”\n\n“Save it for when it matters,” Caelin said. He meant: for later, for when it really tries to kill us. He didn’t say: for when I break myself again.\n\nNyxara’s eyes slid to his hand. “You could practice one more trick tonight,” she said, and when he looked wary, added, “A small one. Helpful. Non-impressive. So you’ll agree.”\n\nHe waited.\n\nShe produced a black iron coin from a pocket, perfectly ordinary except for the faintest ring of cold around it. “Balance it an inch over your palm,” she said. “Just heat below it and a chill above. Don’t let either touch. Contain both. When you can do that, you can shape an edge in air.”\n\n“Is this you helping?” Vex asked, dubious.\n\n“This is me preventing him from burning his thumb off tomorrow,” Nyxara said sweetly.\n\nCaelin tried. It was a child’s parlor trick, cruelly difficult. He built the narrowest pedestal of warm air he could manage and coaxed the coin up on the eddy, then called a breath’s worth of cold to sit on it. The filaments under his skin whispered complaint but did not scream. The coin wobbled. Settled. Wobbled again. Balanced.\n\nHe let it drop into his palm and counted the cost. Small. Acceptable.\n\n“Clever,” he conceded.\n\n“I’m full of surprises,” Nyxara said. Her smile showed no teeth.\n\nThey set watches in pairs.\n\n“Don’t stand alone,” Serana said. Her tone made it order, not advice.\n\nDurgan nodded once and didn’t argue, which told Caelin more than if he had.",

The chalk sigils held their cold stars at the thresholds; the lichen dimmed and brightened with a rhythm that matched no heartbeat the living could claim.\n\n\n\nFirst watch: Thornik and Serana made quiet rounds, counting pillars, counting breaths. Once, far off in a side tunnel, a pebble clicked.\n\n“Guide me,” Serana whispered, just under breath. The reply came in a forked whisper that wasn’t wind.\n\nShield the bearer.\n\nOffer the bearer.\n\nHer chalk snapped in her fist. Thornik looked over; she kept her face neutral, thumb dusting grit from her glove as if that had always been the plan. The ward line brightened, steadied. Her voice did not.\n\nSerana’s hand went to the sword; Thornik’s to the little hammer at his belt. Nothing came.\n\n\n\nSecond watch: Vex and Caelin.\n\nThey sat with their backs to opposite sides of a pillar, daggers and dragonfire keeping each other honest. Vex sharpened a blade with habitual precision. Caelin balanced Nyxara’s black coin an inch above his palm, let it spin like a planet on a column of warm air while a whisper of cold kept it from wandering.\n\n“Your shoulder?” he asked without looking.\n\n“Attached,” she said. “Functional. I complain later.”\n\n“You could let Thornik rebind it.”\n\nVex made a face in the dark and then softened it because there was no one to see. “He fusses.”\n\n“He cares.”\n\n“That’s worse.”\n\nThey sat a while longer, the coin circling in the slow orbit of the too-careful, the scrape-scrape of steel on stone marking seconds. Finally Vex said, low: “You do know this ends badly, yes? The relics. The Seal. Threads like these don’t tie themselves into bows.”\n\n“I know.” Caelin didn’t let the coin fall. “I don’t know what it looks like when it ends. But I know it isn’t clean.”\n\n“That’s the first sensible thing you’ve said since Thornwick.” She breathed out, not quite a laugh. “Keep saying sensible things, Ember-boy. It helps.”\n\n\n\nThird watch: Nyxara and Elowen.\n\nThey kept companionable silence for a long time, because both understood that speech could wake grief and they needed sleep more than they needed philosophy. When Nyxara finally spoke, it was to the chalk mark nearest the Necromancy alcove.\n\n“Your threads are brighter,” she said.\n\nElowen glanced down at the silver braided through her vine-ink. “Borrowed,” she said. “I’ll pay back the interest.”\n\nNyxara tipped her head. “It hurts when you try to ease him now.”\n\n“Yes.” Elowen’s smile was almost tender, as if at a child learning to walk. “So I won’t try unless I must.”\n\n“You’ll be tempted,” Nyxara said.\n\nElowen didn’t deny it. “I will.”\n\n\n\nFourth watch: Durgan and—by Serana’s assignment—Thornik. Except Thornik fell asleep sitting up with his chin on his chest, grand plans finally overridden by tired biology. Durgan didn’t wake him.\n\nHe stood alone with the chalk sigil’s white geometry and his shadow.\n\nIt began as a suggestion. The shadow stretched until it kissed the threshold line, then curled away like a cat from a hot stove. He felt the push—the thing in him testing, calculating. He breathed. Held. Pressed it flat.\n\nA vision slid across his awareness without knocking.\n\nThe central table. Caelin asleep on a bedroll, scale bare in the low light. Durgan’s hand on a knife. Four steps. Kneel. Angle of blade: shallow and long to avoid arteries, deep enough to free the hex, twist at the notch—\n\nHe jerked back into himself with a soundless gasp, hand already halfway to his belt. He closed his fist on empty air until pain brought him back into the body that had not moved.\n\nA hot line opened under his nose. He wiped the blood on the heel of his palm and watched it dry black in the lichen light. Minutes between episodes now. Hours before. Days once.\n\nHe stepped deliberately backward from the chalk and stared at the pillar carvings until the urge lost its edges.\n\n“I will walk away before I can’t stop it,” he told the stone under his breath, and the mountain, practical and ancient, declined to promise anything.\n\n\n\nThe breathing of the Hall changed around false dawn. Not louder—quicker. Someone turned over in a bedroll and muttered a name. The lichen dimmed, then steadied.\n\nCaelin woke from a dream that was only a pressure: Thud. Not near. Not far. Not a heart but something that had decided the rhythm of a heart was a good lie. Once, twice, and then nothing, as if it had leaned close to listen and then, disappointed, moved on.\n\nHe sat up, coin in his palm, and didn’t practice again. The lattice hurt the way fresh bruises hurt. Useable. Unwise.\n\n\n\nThey rose before the Hall would have called it day. The fire-pit stank of cold ash and juniper resin; the chalk sigils were still bright but scuffed at two thresholds as if something had pressed there and reconsidered.\n\nIn the far curve of the vaulted ceiling, a hairline crack ran through one of the load ribs—fine as a drawn thread of ink, barely there, the kind of thing that meant nothing until it meant everything.\n\nNo one looked up.\n\n\n\nThey packed as quietly as seven people could. Straps pulled snug. Knots retied. The last of the water parceled and swallowed. Serana walked the perimeter and refreshed each ward with a careful ninth stroke. The chalk squeaked in the silence.\n\nThat was when the first sound came from the tunnels: a patient scrape like metal testing stone, answered a long moment later by a tapping from the sealed mining spur, and then the slow rhythm of water displaced where none should be moving.\n\nVex’s head came up. “Company,” she said, voice flat.\n\n“Positions,” Serana returned, already in motion. “We move on Thornik’s mark.”\n\nHe lifted the lantern, checked the charcoal lines on the table one last time, and pointed toward the passage that would feed to the Forge Road.\n\n“Here,” he said. “Before the mountain decides for us.”\n\nThey stepped into the breath of the Hall and felt it hold and release around them like a lung that knew their weight and had decided—just this once—to wait.",

With the light came the low sound—felt first in teeth, then in boot-soles, then up through the ribs.\n\nThud.\n\nA breath-long pause—did you imagine it?—then:\n\nThud.\n\nThe ward-line held under Serana’s palm—chalk geometry and nine-stroke precision, the sigils she’d drawn before sleep still bright enough to matter. They stole some of the bass out of the air, damping the pulse like thick velvet over a drum. Not all of it. Not anymore.\n\nScrape from the forge corridor. Tap-tap at the sealed mine. A wet drag through floodwater that should have been still for centuries. The mountain answered with another dull knock that belonged to no mortal heart.\n\nThud.\n\nCaelin woke to that slow count and the smell of old smoke and cold iron. The scale in his forearm held its coal-glow, the pulse tightened—not warning, not ease—like a hand at the small of his back urging him forward. The familiar ache had settled in overnight to its hateful normal. He flexed carefully. He could manage small work today—if he paid every time.\n\nSerana kept her hand on the runes. No prayer came. Nothing answered. The chalk held because chalk didn’t need permission—only ratios and repetition and the stubbornness of someone who hadn’t stopped yet. “They’ve ringed the entrances,” she said, voice low and steady. “We don’t wait to be tested to failure. We choose our ground.”\n\nVex was already up, knives in hand, standing where the Illusion alcove threw tricky reflections into the corners. \"Fast careful,\" she said. \"And if that's impossible, just fast.\" She glanced at Caelin's arm. \"Beacon-boy, if you could stop being a lighthouse—\"\n\n\"Working on it,\" he said, and because the truth cost less than a lie, added, \"I can't.\"\n\nThornik had grandfather's journal spread on the black table, brass goggles riding his brow, big fingers unshakably precise. His beard smelled faintly of beeswax oil and iron dust. \"Forge Road's our best way out—old ore route, still marked sound when Grandfather walked it. Six hours if stone loves us, twelve if it doesn't.\"\n\nElowen sat cross-legged near the Abjuration alcove where her vine-ink picked up a little of the ward-light, emerald threaded with silver-gold. She lay her palm to the floor and winced—stone fever, pressure, the fabric of the place pulled too tight. \"This chamber holds for now,\" she said. \"Everything tied to the sanctum's bones is failing. Whatever hunts us is... patient. Learning the ward geometry.\"\n\nA smear of darkness slid under the rune-line at her feet—a thin filament of shadow testing the gap between two chiselled glyphs. The ward flared white-hot. For one knife-bright instant the shadow became a living silhouette of its owner's hand—tendons, knuckles, too many joints—then ignited. It fled screaming without a sound, scuttling back as a scatter of ash that ran like insects, burned to nothing before it reached the dark.\n\nNo one breathed.\n\n\"They're clever,\" Nyxara said softly from the Necromancy alcove, as if admiring a well-played move in someone else's game. Her purple eyes tracked the ward seam a beat longer. \"Not clever enough.\"\n\nOn the edge of the chamber Durgan stood with his back to stone, eyes pale and unblinking. His shadow lay neat at his boots. It twitched once toward the ward-line when the burned ash fled, and he crushed it flat until his jaw clicked.\n\nThe pressure of holding it down built behind his eyes like fingers pressing into his temples. When he finally released his concentration, a thin warmth trickled from his left nostril. He wiped it with the back of his hand—checking, confirming. The skin came away with a single red smear.\n\nFirst blood, he thought, and tucked his hand away before anyone could see. How many more before I can't stop it anymore?\n\n“Move before they learn a new trick,” Serana said. She pushed to her feet and didn’t look back to check the wards. They held or they didn’t. Either way, the only answer was forward.\n\nVex rolled a shoulder, felt the pull of healing ribs beneath. \"Define intact.\"\n\n\"Alive,\" Serana said. \"Everything else is optional.\"\n\nThornik snapped the journal shut and slung on his pack. \"Forge Road starts through the transmutation arch. Watch your steps. The mountain is currently... structurally questionable but functional.\"\n\n\"That phrase has never comforted me,\" Vex said.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to,\" Thornik replied cheerfully. \"It's supposed to be true.\"\n\nThey packed to travel-light: water, rope, wedges and braces for Thornik, rations like stone, no spare comforts. The ward-line pulsed off-beat once, a tired strobe. The bass in the room thickened.\n\nThud.\n\n\"Go,\" Serana said.\n\nThey went.",

The air turned wet and metallic; the tunnel smelled of wet granite, old slag, and the copper tang of slow rust. Thornik's lantern burned low, the flame cupped, throwing a disciplined cone of light.\n\nHe read the stone as he walked—hairline fractures, load paths, the cross-rib where an ancient brace took more weight than it should. He laid spring-steel wedges into seams with a quiet click, braces kissing the stone to buy them minutes later when seconds might matter. \"Don't touch the walls,\" he said. \"They're listening.\"\n\nThe sound from below grew clearer as the wards' dampening effect faded with distance. No longer muffled. Present. Rhythmic.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nAn hour in, the mountain shivered. Dust fell in silky threads. Everyone stopped on instinct, breath held until the tremor passed.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Serana said, and they did.\n\nThey came to a collapse—a doorway half-buried by a spill of dwarf-cut granite. Thornik knelt. \"Option one: explosive. Brings the ceiling to visit. Option two: levers. Time we don't have.\"\n\nCaelin stepped beside him, put his right hand on the keystone, and called the smallest heat he could bear—a focused candle on a pinhead, nothing grand. The scale warmed; the ache sharpened like a pulled muscle. Granite ticked and softened to a bead of glass the crowbar could bite.\n\nThornik levered. Stone slid. Passage opened.\n\nCaelin pulled back, breath hissing. The filaments flared angry red, then settled back to baseline coal-glow. He didn't count what he had left. He didn't know. He only knew there was still enough to hurt and not enough to be careless.\n\n\"You know,\" Nyxara said as she followed him through, \"most men would have tried a bonfire to impress me.\"\n\n\"I'm rationing,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Tragic. I had a speech about stamina prepared.\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"Save it for someone persuadable.\"\n\nA narrow twitch at the corner of her mouth—caught between miffed and entertained. \"You're going to be the end of me, Ember-boy.\"\n\n\"Get in line,\" Vex called from the far side, one hand pressed to her ribs as if checking they still held. \"We're all waiting our turn.\"\n\nThe mountain answered with a deeper thud that rattled loose grit down Caelin's neck.\n\nThey moved on.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nA long corridor followed—clean, quiet, no falls, no scrapes—only the heartbeat below growing clearer as the wards' bass-trap effect faded with distance. The sound no longer felt distant. It felt present—not beneath them specifically, but everywhere at once, resonating through the mountain like a heartbeat felt through pressed palms.\n\nIn the hush, a shadow-dart whispered along the floor ahead of them, a hair-thin ribbon sliding fast. It struck an old dwarven inlay they barely saw—a sliver of ward rune hidden in decorative filigree—and the floor line erupted in a curtain of sheet-fire two hands high. The dart became a coil of screaming soot-snakes that fled backward into the dark.\n\n\"Good,\" Vex murmured. \"Let it keep proving we shouldn't turn around.\"\n\nTwo hours in, they crawled through a chamber where the ceiling had molted down blocks the size of coffins. \"Fast careful,\" Thornik said. \"Step where I step. Don't even breathe loudly.\"\n\nVex's boot knocked a small stone. It skittered. A support block shifted a fraction, and the chamber groaned like a sleeping giant turning over. They sprinted the last ten feet in a pelting rain of grit and pea-stone. Not a full collapse. A reminder.\n\nBehind them, the pursuit-scrapes paused. Listening. Counting. Herding.\n\n\"They want us deeper,\" Durgan said without looking back. His voice was flat, factual.\n\n\"Then we go deeper on our terms,\" Serana answered.\n\nThree hours in, Elowen stopped with her hand to the wall. The rootwork in her arms brightened; a single vine-filament along her wrist blackened another shade, flaking an ash petal onto the floor. \"The Weave is screaming ahead. A major brace near a junction is under more stress than it can carry. If it goes while we're under it—\"\n\n\"How long?\" Serana asked.\n\n\"Minutes. Hours. Or it started while I was speaking.\"\n\n\"Faster,\" Vex said, and winced as her ribs protested the thought.\n\nThey went faster.\n\nFour hours in, another choke point. Thornik measured. Levers would work—eventually. Explosives would kill them. Caelin set his palm to a stone and gave it heat like a match-head. Glass bloomed under his hand; Thornik heaved; the way opened.\n\nPain threaded Caelin's lattice, not a scream, a serrated sigh. The scale pulsed angry red for three heartbeats, then faded back to coal-glow. Manageable, for now.\n\nNyxara fell in beside him again, voice a ribbon of dark amusement. \"Refreshing, this restraint. I've been tracking something hot all morning, but I suppose I can exercise patience.\"\n\n\"Tracking the path,\" Caelin said.\n\nHer eyes glinted. \"Among other things.\"\n\n\"Save those speeches too,\" he said, and kept moving.\n\nA laugh. Low. Honest. Then the heartbeat underfoot stole the humor back.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nFive hours in, Serana held a thin, mobile ward over them to shed small falls and carry the sound of their feet away. It flickered once, a brief stutter that she forced flat. She didn't meet anyone's eyes.\n\n\"Define 'fine,'\" Vex said.\n\n\"Not dying,\" Serana said.\n\n\"Optional,\" Vex muttered.\n\nThornik's breath rasped under his cheer. \"We're close to the junction chambers,\" he said. \"Three-way split: mines, smelters, caldera to surface. The caldera stair is our goal.\"\n\n\"Unless the mountain disagrees,\" Vex said.\n\n\"Stone always gets a vote,\" Thornik said. \"Today I'm asking it nicely.\"\n\nSix hours in, the tunnel widened without warning.\n\nThey swung into a vast chamber where the walls curved like the inside of a bell.\n\nBridges of black iron spanned the emptiness—hundreds of them—some whole, some snapped mid-arch and hanging by cables older than language. Below, molten seams traced geometric rivers through the dark, glowing like veins under translucent skin.\n\nThornik's breath fogged his goggles. \"This isn't natural construction. It's metallurgy on a planetary scale.\"\n\nNyxara's voice echoed softly: \"Or worship with better tools.\"\n\nThe Chamber of Echoes.\n\nSerana held her torch close to inscriptions along the nearest bridge rail—spiral glyphs carved deep and inlaid with gold now blackened by heat. Caelin brushed one with his gloved fingers. It thrummed faintly under the touch, familiar in the way of fever dreams.\n\n\"Same pattern as the Seal,\" he said.\n\nThornik nodded. \"Then we're standing in its bloodstream.\"\n\nVex looked down into the molten rivers far below. \"Let's try not to puncture anything vital.\"\n\nThe hum shifted mid-sentence—Thornik's last word echoed a heartbeat later, repeated perfectly but stretched thin, like parchment under strain.\n\nThen Caelin's breath followed, an exhale caught and replayed back to him, slightly off-tempo.\n\nThey all stopped.\n\nSerana whispered, \"Echo.\"\n\nBut the word came back not once, not twice, but in every voice in the group—each one slightly wrong. Serana, Vex, Nyxara, Caelin, Thornik, Durgan, Elowen—all overlapping, all whispering echo in a chorus that didn't belong to any of them.\n\nThe sound faded like a tide withdrawing.\n\nNo one spoke for a full minute after.\n\nThey moved quickly across one of the intact bridges, giving the central darkness wide berth. The air here tasted of coin and ozone. Light from their torches bled into the rock instead of reflecting, as if the stone drank it.\n\nHalfway across, Elowen tilted her head. \"Do you hear them?\"\n\nSerana frowned. \"Just echoes.\"\n\n\"No,\" Elowen said. \"They're trying to remember what they were saying.\"\n\nThe air quivered. A dozen faint voices whispered over one another, too faint to catch—then aligned, forming a single phrase in Draconic that Caelin understood without translation.\n\n\"Hold the flame. Guard the law. Bury the cost.\"\n\nThe same three lines, repeating in different cadences, layered until they blurred into music.\n\nThe scale in his arm began to glow faintly through his sleeve—a bright warm pulse of recognition.\n\n\"I've heard this before,\" he said.\n\nSerana's face tightened. \"Prophecy?\"\n\n\"Command,\" Caelin whispered. \"But it doesn't know who to give it to.\"\n\nThornik produced a tuning rod from his pack—a spare, cruder than the one the mountain had shattered two days ago, but it would serve—ignoring Vex’s muttered warning. “If it’s an acoustic record, we can pull more data.”\n\nHe struck the rod lightly against stone.\n\nThe resulting tone spiraled outward, repeating itself, climbing octaves until the air vibrated visibly. The chamber answered.\n\nA column of sound formed in the air—dense enough to distort the light—and within it flickered outlines of figures at work: massive shapes, part dragon, part machine, hammering something that shone like molten sunrise.\n\nThen the image stuttered and bled away, leaving silence so heavy it felt deliberate.\n\nA fine mist of dust fell from the ceiling, glowing faintly.\n\nElowen looked up in alarm. \"Stop. It's—\"\n\nToo late. The sound collapsed inward, a sonic implosion that slammed everyone to their knees. Ears rang. Torches snuffed.\n\nWhen Caelin's vision cleared, Thornik was bleeding from the nose, staring dazed at his shattered rod.\n\n\"Note,\" he croaked. \"Don't do that again.\"\n\nVex kicked the broken metal off the platform, grimacing at the pull in her ribs. \"Brilliant deduction.\"\n\nNyxara stood very still, eyes half-lidded as if listening inward. \"They aren't ghosts,\" she said finally. \"They're instructions. The mountain replays them when something familiar enters the system. We woke the archive.\"\n\nSerana drew a slow breath. \"An archive of what?\"\n\nNyxara met her gaze. \"Every order the gods ever gave their creations. Every one that failed.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—then again, brighter. The heat licked up Caelin's arm, across his collarbone, behind his eyes. Voices flooded in—thousands, layered, overlapping. Command structures, prayers, screams of obedience and defiance all at once.\n\nFor a second, he saw through their memories: dragons kneeling to unseen figures, humans bound by glowing chains, cities forged then unmade by song.\n\nHe staggered, gripping the nearest railing.\n\nElowen's hand found his shoulder. \"Stay here,\" she said fiercely. \"Stay present.\"\n\nHe breathed through it, the images fading like cooling iron.\n\nSerana caught his other arm, voice sharp. \"Caelin!\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" he lied. The scale flickered white-hot for an instant—lie detected—then settled back.\n\nThornik, pale but upright, whispered, \"It recognized him. The system thinks he's one of them.\"\n\n\"Then we move,\" Vex said. \"Before it decides to collect.\"\n\nThey crossed the chamber quickly, their footsteps echoing in unnatural sync. Each time the echoes came back, they were half a beat too slow—as if something behind them was learning to walk.\n\nNear the far archway, the air shimmered. At first it was just heat distortion from below. Then it wasn't.\n\nA voice said, \"Caelin.\"\n\nHe froze. The sound came from behind—his own tone, precise down to the hesitation between syllables.\n\nEveryone turned. The path behind them was empty.\n\n\"Not funny,\" Vex said automatically, though no one had spoken.\n\n\"I didn't—\" Caelin began, but stopped. His throat had gone dry.\n\nThe voice came again, softer. \"Caelin. Follow.\"\n\nThornik muttered a formula under his breath, trying to anchor the acoustics. \"Reflected sound... but there's no source.\"\n\nNyxara's smile was faint. \"Oh, there's a source. It just borrowed your mouth to speak.\"\n\nThe echo shifted targets.\n\n\"Elowen.\"\n\nHer own name, spoken like a sigh through leaves.\n\nShe staggered. \"The forest uses names for roots. This isn't the forest.\"\n\nSerana stepped forward. \"Stop listening.\"\n\n\"That's not how ears work,\" Vex snapped, hand moving to a dagger hilt.\n\nThen it spoke again—Serana's voice this time, steady and cold. \"Faith bends. It doesn't always break.\"\n\nSerana's jaw clenched. \"That's what I said last night.\"\n\n\"It remembers,\" Nyxara said. \"It's collecting words that meant something.\"\n\nThornik, because curiosity survived even terror, called softly into the dark. \"Thornik.\"\n\nNothing.\n\nHe exhaled, relieved—then heard it whispered back three times in a child's voice, each repetition younger than the last.\n\nHe stumbled back hard enough to knock his goggles askew. \"Never again,\" he muttered. \"Never—again.\"\n\nThe air trembled, repeating the words in exact cadence: \"Never again.\"\n\nThen quieter: \"Never.\"\n\nLight warped with the next pulse of the hum. The walls sweated condensation that smelled of iron and oil. Their torches flared green, then white. The flame stretched sideways, casting shadows that now mouthed along with the voices.\n\nSerana tried to summon her wardlight. The sigil formed, flickered, and folded in on itself until only a faint circle of ash remained.\n\n\"I can't hold it,\" she whispered. \"Even faith has an echo.\"\n\nDurgan drew his axe, slow and steady. \"Forward. Always forward.\"\n\n\"Why not back?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Because back isn't there anymore,\" he said, and pointed.\n\nThe corridor behind them had sealed—not collapsed, but simply wasn't, replaced by seamless metal still warm to the touch.\n\nThornik stared. \"Topography editing. It's rewriting as we move.\"\n\n\"Then we move fast,\" Caelin said.\n\nThe scale pulsed once toward the left passage—hot, insistent. Not the black-violet of corruption, but the bright warm pulse of recognition. Caelin didn’t wait for a vote.\n\n“Left,” he said, and moved.\n\n“Trusting the thing that just tried to eat us?” Vex asked, falling in behind him.\n\n“It’s not trust,” he said. “It’s recognition.”\n\nAs they walked, the walls began to whisper fragments of old conversations: Vex mocking Thornik's kettle, Serana's muttered prayers, Elowen's earlier warning about warmth.\n\nThe mountain had been listening since Thornwick. Now it was talking back.\n\nElowen's hand brushed Caelin's arm. \"The flame mark answers to more than one master,\" she said.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied. \"I just don't know which is winning.\"\n\nThe corridor opened into another chamber—a narrow nave lined with glass coffers filled with ash. Light flickered inside each like dying hearts.\n\nThen his own voice came from the darkness ahead: \"I called the fire. I killed her to save you.\"\n\nEvery muscle in Caelin's body locked.\n\nThat sentence didn't exist outside his memory. No one else had ever heard it.\n\nSerana stepped closer, sword half drawn. \"Who said that?\"\n\nCaelin swallowed. \"I did. Once.\"\n\nThe echo stepped forward—his height, his face, his wound still glowing faintly through translucent skin.\n\nIt smiled. \"Still burning,\" it said.\n\nHe backed away. The others followed his lead, weapons ready but useless against something made of memory.\n\nThe echo tilted its head, movements just slightly off-beat, as if learning how joints worked.\n\nWhen it spoke again, it used all their voices together.\n\n\"We are the Seal.\"\n\nThe hum surged; dust fell in bright spirals. The glass coffers flared, each releasing a puff of ash that drifted like breath.\n\nCaelin reached for fire, stopped himself, forced the heat inward until it was pain and not power. The scale burned angry red under his skin but he held it, contained it.\n\nThe mimic paused—as if confused by restraint—and in that instant Serana hurled her dagger through its chest.\n\nThe blade passed through light and hit the wall behind with a sharp, clean clink.\n\nThe echo shattered into sound—hundreds of overlapping syllables that faded into silence.\n\nWhen hearing returned, Vex said softly, \"Next time, we burn it first.\"\n\n\"No,\" Caelin said. \"We learn why it knows my name.\"\n\nThey left the chamber in silence, the scale in Caelin's arm fading from red back to baseline coal-glow.\n\nBehind them, the shards of light pulled together, reforming a faint outline.\n\nIt whispered after them in Caelin's voice, calm and sure: \"Still burning.\"\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nThey reached the far archway and the space opened like a cathedral of living rock. Three vaulted passages split at precise angles; ribs of stone arced floor to ceiling in calculated load-bearing perfection.\n\nThornik consulted his journal one last time, marked a route with charcoal. \"Junction chambers. The caldera route is our way out.\"\n\nBut the ribs were cracking. Visible stress fractures spider-webbing across supports that had held for millennia. Dust sifted in steady streams. The air smelled of ozone and pulverized granite.\n\nAnd the sound—\n\nThud.\n\nDeep. Resonant. Felt through boot-soles more than heard.\n\nThud. Thud.\n\nThe Seal's heartbeat. Not from one direction. From everywhere. The mountain itself had become its chamber.\n\n\"Everyone move,\" Thornik said, voice tight. \"This entire structure is about to—\"\n\nThe mountain shook.",

                "text": "ACT III: THE COLLAPSE\n\nThe junction chamber came apart in stages.\n\nFirst: the leftmost rib sheared. Not slowly. Not with warning. Just—SNAP—and tons of stone cascaded from the vault in wagon-sized blocks.\n\n\"LEFT SIDE!\" Vex shouted as they scrambled right and the floor where they'd been standing vanished under rubble.\n\nThe mountain's rhythm broke into a riot: THUD--thud--THUD—thud--THUD, a crowd of heartbeats not their own. Caelin's pulse tried to follow and stumbled; a sick skip behind his sternum knocked his balance half a step off. Dust hissed from the ribs like breath through teeth. The air carried the wet-clay breath of new fractures and a metal tang, and static prickled along their forearms.\n\nThe scale in Caelin's arm blazed black-violet at the edges—full corruption bloom, the Seal's influence flooding the chamber like invisible tide. Not close. Not here. But present. Aware. The obsidian plate pulsed irregular, excited: thud-THUD-thud-THUD.\n\nIt wants me, he understood. The Seal. It can FEEL the Ember. And it's using whatever power it has to collapse the mountain, to drop me closer to it.\n\nSecond: the right-hand arch—their intended exit—let go like a builder's curse fulfilled. The pre-stressed keystone clicked, a clean crack ran the span, and the arch folded inward in a slate-gray avalanche that sealed the passage throat to floor.\n\nShadows slid ahead of the collapse—thin whips testing the raw edge where ward-glyphs didn't quite reach. Caelin's scale flared red-gold; its halo seared those probes to curling soot that skittered away like burned spiders.\n\nThird: the floor cracked. A black lightning zigzag split the chamber from waist to wall and widened with every breath. The Seal's poly-rhythm devolved into pure thrill—THUD-thud-THUD-thud-THUD—no pattern, just a chained thing thrashing in joy at the scent of fire.\n\nELOWEN was at the rear—counting heads, keeping stragglers from becoming ghosts—when the slab under her boots lowered, wrong as a breath drawn by stone. She saw Durgan sprint clear; Nyxara took the widening cut in one clean leap; Caelin turned back toward her—\n\nNot enough time.\n\nShe chose.\n\nShe slammed her staff and called the new magic: not growth, load-sharing. Roots erupted from living wood, racing across the failing geometry in a glowing web—but these weren't the sickly pale green of dying nature-magic. They blazed emerald shot through with threads of silver-gold, the Abjuration influence from the Deep Hall now woven into her very being.\n\nThe roots didn't brace the mountain; they borrowed weight—took the load for three breaths, then two, then one—as the transformed power coursed through her tattoos until the channels screamed. The smell of burning green knifed through dust—sharp chlorophyll-sweet, life paying itself out, but underneath it the metallic tang of ward-magic being consumed.\n\nThe web held. The lowering paused.\n\n\"GO!\" Her voice cut the riot clean. \"I can't hold—MOVE!\"\n\nSerana’s hand went up—chalk sigil, instinct, geometry she still believed in—and the ward simply wasn’t there. The mountain swallowed the shape before it formed. She chose the only thing left: she hooked Caelin’s harness with both hands and dragged him back before the slab surged. She chose too: one lost or many. Not a prayer. Just arithmetic.\n\nHe wrenched to go anyway. The floor lurched.\n\nElowen's tattoos burned from emerald-and-silver to pure white. The root-web flared to ash, spent—not shattered, not explosive, simply gone. The transformation magic that had given her new purpose consumed itself in one final act of protection.\n\nThe slab dropped. She went with it, swallowed in a grinding maw of stone. No cry. No light—neither green nor gold. No staff—wood splintered as the last charge emptied.\n\nDust boiled and sealed the black mouth into a gray scar.\n\nAbove, the riot in the rock pitched higher, delighted. Caelin lunged for the edge—\n\n\"MOVE OR—\" Nyxara started, a warning that became prophecy as their section lowered under their boots.\n\nThey fell.\n\nOne heartbeat: solid stone. The next: nothing. Caelin tumbled through choking dust, the world a roll of jagged edges and red sparks. Instinct screamed heat the air—stupid instinct. Hot wind doesn't hold weight. He tucked, took the rock on shoulder and thigh, let pain be ballast. A debris slope caught him—cruel, angled, still better than a pit—and he shed momentum in skin and blood.\n\nParallel on the slide, Nyxara fell with the eerie grace of someone who'd made a career out of surviving bad ideas. Pact-power whispered—no force, no shove—simply convinced the falling stones she wasn't part of the story. Angles and experience did the rest. She surfed the avalanche to a jutting ledge and cut speed in a low, bruising crouch.\n\nThey hit. Caelin sprawled, gasping; his right arm lit in a lattice of red pain as the scale jarred against bone. The filaments flared angry red, screaming, then slowly faded back toward coal-glow.\n\nAbove, stone sealed on stone.\n\n\"CAELIN!\" Serana's voice knifed through muffling tons. \"CAN YOU HEAR ME?\"\n\nHe coughed grit. \"ALIVE! WE'RE ALIVE!\"\n\n\"CAN'T REACH YOU! ROUTE'S SEALED!\"\n\n\"WE'LL FIND ANOTHER WAY!\"\n\n\"SURFACE EXIT—EAST FACE—WE'LL WAIT!\" Thin as thread, then gone. Either distance, or the mountain decided they'd said enough.\n\nCaelin sat, cataloguing damage: bruises blooming, shoulder shrieking, the lattice aching but holding. He hadn't cast. Could have. Wanted to. Didn't. Small victory.\n\nNyxara tested joints—grimace, then a shrug. \"Sprained. Mobile. Ten out of ten would not recommend.\"\n\nHe stood, staggered, found purpose. \"Mark the wall. Let them know.\"\n\nHe burned Draconic into a clean slab with a tight ember thread: ALIVE. FOLLOWING HEAT. FIND US SURFACE EAST.\n\nBeneath it, he added Thornik's party sigil—three short strokes, one long. So the others would know it was them.\n\nThe scale's glow dimmed from ember-red back to soft coal as the magic settled.\n\nSomewhere beyond the sealed chokes and ruined ribs, the noise shifted. The riot dropped back to patience; the world's pressure exhaled.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nNot below, not above—everywhere. Presence, not location. Influence bleeding through leagues of stone.\n\n\"Time to move,\" Nyxara said, already limping toward the only path that wasn't trying to kill them yet. \"Before the mountain changes its mind. Or the pets find a new seam.\"\n\nHe stood there a moment longer than the task required.\n\nHe kept thinking of small things. The way she’d pressed two fingers to stone and said it listens back. The first time she eased the lattice-burn and he’d been too surprised to say thank you. The vine-marks on her wrists the morning they left the Deep Hall—two more blackened, and she hadn’t mentioned it, just kept walking. He hadn’t mentioned it either. He’d thought there was time.\n\nThat was the part that would stay with him. Not the sound of the slab. The assumption of time.\n\nCaelin looked once at the sealed scar. No token. No miracle. The stone didn’t care, and he said it anyway: “I’m sorry.”\n\nThe scale warmed—acknowledgment, not comfort.\n\nHe put her name away in the place where you put things you can’t carry and can’t put down. Then he turned into the dark.\n\n\n\nUp in the junction they'd abandoned, dust settled where green-and-gold light had been. No voice. No staff. No trace.\n\nThe mountain's riot eased back to patient counting, as if the chain below had tested the links and found them holding—for now.\n\nDurgan stood at the edge of the sealed passage, ice-blue eyes tracking the crack where Caelin had disappeared. His shadow had leapt for that crack like a starving animal smelling meat—reaching, stretching ten feet across rubble before he crushed it flat with will and pain.\n\nThe pressure burst something. Blood ran from both nostrils now, not a trickle but a stream. He wiped it with the back of his hand, stared at the red smear, then tucked his hand away.\n\nFaster, he thought. It's happening faster.\n\nNo one had seen. They were too busy staring at where their companions had fallen.\n\n“We move,” Serana said, voice hollow but functional. “Find another route. Reach the surface. Meet them at the east exit.”\n\nShe didn’t say if they’re alive. The silence did it for her.\n\nThornik unrolled his journal with shaking hands. “Vent shaft route. Steep. Narrow. But it reaches surface.” He marked it with charcoal, the line wavering. “Two hours. Maybe three.”\n\n“Then we climb,” Vex said. Her voice was flat, empty of its usual edge. She pressed a hand to her ribs, felt them creak, and kept it there. She turned to move—and caught the tail end of Durgan tucking his hand into his sleeve. Not fast enough. The wrong colour on his upper lip.\n\nShe held the look for one breath. Filed it. Said nothing. Elowen was gone and Caelin was somewhere below and her ribs were broken and there was only so much room.\n\nThey turned toward the vent shaft entrance—a crack in the chamber wall barely wide enough for shoulders.\n\nBehind them, the Seal counted.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nPatient. Waiting.",

In the dark, distance turned elastic, measured only by the steady coal-glow of Caelin's scale and the pricked red points far below.\n\nHe counted steps so he wouldn’t count losses. One breath. One more. Again.\n\nThe scale sat at coal-glow—baseline, steady, indifferent to grief. He focused on that. On the temperature of the stone under his boots, the pull of the debris slope, the small calculations of footing. He was good at small calculations. He had been making them since Thornwick and they had kept him useful and upright and he was going to keep making them now, in this tunnel, in this dark, until the habit of surviving outlasted the habit of feeling.\n\nIt wasn’t working especially well.\n\nNyxara moved beside him with careful economy despite the twist in her ankle, saying nothing for long stretches, then: \"You're quiet. Brooding, or rationing air?\"\n\n\"Thinking,\" he said.\n\n\"About the druid who bought us time.\" No softness to it. Just truth.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"She chose,\" Nyxara said. \"You honor it by surviving, not by drowning in guilt.\" A beat. \"And by keeping that thing in your arm from getting us both killed.\"\n\nThey dropped onto a broader landing. Caelin paused, burned a quick line on the wall: ALIVE → and beneath it the simple four-stroke sigil Thornik had taught them—three short, one long.\n\nThe scale's glow brightened briefly as he worked, then settled back to baseline coal.\n\nThey moved again. The air warmed by degrees until the tunnel opened like a throat into a chamber so vast it made their footfalls feel impertinent.\n\nThe Forge Caldera wasn't a room; it was a memory made of stone.\n\nTiered galleries ringed a polished obsidian floor. Dozens of cold hearths stood in concentric circles around a central pit, their banks still faintly embered as if the world had simply forgotten to finish cooling. The place smelled of quenched steel and old oil; somewhere in the rock a thin, impossible ringing went on, like the last note of a hammer that never quite died.\n\nCaelin's Ember answered with a low pulse; his scale brightened from coal to ember-red—not warning, but recognition. Bright warm pulse of resonance.\n\n\"This is where they forged the Concord,\" Nyxara murmured, actual awe loosening her voice.\n\nCaelin nodded, chest tight. Heritage felt like grief when it came late.\n\nAcross the caldera, a bridge arched over the central pit—elegant, dwarven, impossible. Beyond it, stairs spiraled toward a pale wash of daylight.\n\n\"Route's there,\" he said. \"We skirt the pit.\"\n\nThey set out along the perimeter, keeping the corrupted glow at center-left and plenty of stone between. It wasn't the black-violet ache of the Seal; it was old taint, a bruise that never healed.\n\nHalfway around, Nyxara's footing went soft on a talus spill and she started to slide. She caught herself on a carved rail, hissed at the jolt, then whispered something that wasn't words so much as suggestion. Her pact-whisper slid across the debris—not force but permission—and the fall obliged, choosing other paths. She righted, breath steadying.\n\nAround them, the scale showed a brief silver shimmer—proximity to active magic—then faded back.\n\n\"Efficient,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Persuasive,\" she corrected, amused. \"My specialty.\"\n\nThey reached the bridge. On the rail, half-buried in dust, lay a fractured tool: a joint-mark chisel with dwarvish geometry on one cheek and a draconic maker-sigil on the other—a language of edges and fire.\n\nCaelin picked it up, wiped grime with his sleeve, and tucked it into his pack. \"Proof,\" he said, thinking of Thornik. \"For the councils who don't believe.\"\n\nOn the near abutment, he burned the party sigil and a neat ↗ EAST arrow into the stone. \"In case they come this way,\" he said.\n\nNyxara limped onto the span, then paused to breathe. \"Not to be indelicate,\" she said, tone going bright with mischief, \"but we're alone, nearly died, and you still haven't tried to hold my hand for courage. Should I be insulted?\"\n\n\"Flirting seems inefficient,\" Caelin said, and meant it.\n\nShe laughed—genuine, quick. \"Impossible to embarrass. Refreshing.\" She patted his shoulder, friendly, not coy. \"I'll keep trying anyway. Everyone breaks eventually.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'm going to.\"\n\n\"That's what makes it interesting.\"\n\nThey crossed without looking down. The staircase beyond breathed knife-cold air flecked with the mineral tang of altitude. Daylight brightened from rumor to promise.\n\nThey climbed, and the caldera's endless ringing faded behind them like a heartbeat choosing to be memory.\n\nThud. Thud. Thud.\n\nDistant. Patient. Still counting.\n\nAt the final landing, a door waited—dwarf-carved, sealed by ice grown old enough to be stubborn. Caelin set two fingers of heat to the latch: just enough to soften, not enough to cost. The mechanism sighed; the slab rolled aside.\n\nThe scale pulsed angry red briefly—small magic, small cost—then settled back.\n\nDaylight. Sky. A ledge chiseled into the mountain's east face.\n\nThe air was knife-cold and clean, spiced with sun-warmed lichen and far pine-smoke dragged upslope by a contrary breeze.\n\nNyxara closed her eyes and stood in it like a priest. \"Surface,\" she said. \"I had a bet with myself.\"\n\n\"You win?\"\n\n\"I always do.\"\n\nThey didn't linger. Caelin oriented—sun angle, ridge line, memory of shouted directions through stone. \"Forge Road exit should be two hours along this band.\"\n\n\"Then let's not give the mountain time to change its mind,\" Nyxara said, and they set off along the ledge, the Emberpeaks glowering polite and ancient behind them.",

                "text": "ACT V: ABOVE — THE VENT SHAFT ROUTE (Serana, Vex, Thornik, Durgan)\n\nThe vent shaft was a stone throat that refused to swallow.\n\nThornik went first, shoulders scraping both walls, muttering cheerfully obscene things at geology. Vex slid after him sideways, breath clipped to keep her ribs from complaining out loud. Serana followed, armor ghosting sparks from old rock. Durgan brought up the rear, dragging nothing but a long, obedient shadow.\n\nGrit rained in fits. Serana laced a paper-thin ward over their faces—muscle memory, not miracle—and it skinned the dust from their eyes when the shaft shed a handful of centuries. The light was hers—steady gold from trained discipline, not divine gift—and it held.\n\n\"Remind me,\" Thornik grunted, wedging through a pinch, \"why I volunteered the route most likely to make me a cork.\"\n\n\"Because the alternative involved dying beautifully underground,\" Vex said. She tried a small breath; her ribs sparked protest. She hid the wince behind a scowl. \"You also said, and I quote, 'Left shaft has the coldest air—surface that way.'\"\n\n\"Present-Thornik applauds Past-Thornik's olfactory heroism,\" he said, pleased despite himself.\n\nThey squeezed into a run of broader tunnel, air colder, cleaner. Frost rimed old soot on the stone. Above them: a ribbon of blue like a promise.\n\nSerana climbed on discipline more than faith. Her goddess had been a static-laced channel for days; the old prayers returned as faint as wishful thinking. Fine. Duty would do. Duty and the ward under her skin, thin as paper and twice as stubborn.\n\nBehind, Durgan stopped once, hand braced to the wall. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand—checking, confirming—but the skin came away clean.\n\nNot yet, he thought. But soon.\n\nHe could feel it building. The intervals between shadow-tests were shortening. What had been hours was now minutes. He dug his nails into his palm until pain returned his hands to him, then climbed on.\n\nAt a three-way split, Thornik sniffed the drafts, checked his grandfather's blood-spattered diagram, and pointed left. \"Coldest. And it tastes like snow,\" he said, delighted.\n\n\"Your nose is a menace,\" Vex said, grimacing as she tried to keep pace. The ribs pulled with every breath.\n\n\"It's also getting us out,\" Thornik said, gentler than the banter wanted to be.\n\nThey climbed another hour, then the shaft widened to a slot of white.\n\nThe foursome spilled onto a ledge scraped by old avalanches, the world dropping away in a dignified hurry.\n\nSky. Actual, indifferent sky.\n\nThornik shaded his eyes, traced the east face. \"There—half-hidden by scree. The primary Forge Road exit. If they made it through the forges, they'll come out there.\"\n\n\"How far?\" Serana asked.\n\n\"Two hours along the band. Maybe less if the goats have been generous.\"\n\n\"Then we move,\" Serana said. She looked once at the mountain, where the wind carved the ridges into saints and knives, and whispered the two words she hadn't let herself say aloud: \"For Elowen.\"\n\nVex's hand found her dagger hilt, white-knuckled. She said nothing. Didn't need to.\n\nThey started the traverse, Durgan last, shadow flat and patient at his heels.",

Nyxara kept to his left—habit now, where the drop yawned wider—and made a show of not leaning on him.\n\n\"Almost there,\" she said. \"See? No dramatic rescues required. Very dull.\"\n\n\"Would've helped if you'd fallen,\" he said, then realized how it sounded. \"To get it over with.\" He grimaced. \"That was poorly phrased.\"\n\n\"Adorable,\" she said, delighted. \"Points for honesty.\"\n\nThey rounded a buttress; the ledge widened.\n\nAbove: Thornik and Vex took first watch positions overlooking the cave mouth. The air bit their teeth; the lichen patches on sun-facing rock bled a pleasant, warm smell that didn't belong to cold places.\n\n\"They're late,\" Vex said, hand pressed to her ribs.\n\n\"They're alive,\" Thornik countered, because you had to choose which truth to feed.\n\nBelow: A glint of metal ahead—a buckle on a pack strap—then the shape wearing it resolved into Thornik, broader than the mountain remembered.\n\nCaelin lifted a hand.\n\nAbove: \"Movement,\" Thornik said, and Vex was already rising, jaw tight as the ribs reminded her she was made of meat and stubbornness.\n\nSerana stood slower, as if unwilling to jinx it, and Durgan's eyes found a coal-glow he'd been both dreading and needing.\n\nBelow: Nyxara waved like they'd come across friends at a festival. \"Well. How convenient.\"\n\nAbove: \"They're alive,\" Serana said, and didn't smile so much as allow the expression to happen to her face.\n\n\n\nThey met on a rubble-shelf wide enough for six people and too small for grief.\n\nSerana's gauntleted hand settled on Caelin's shoulder—not a hug, just proof. \"You made it.\"\n\n\"So did you,\" he said.\n\nThornik checked them both with brisk, professional hands, then blinked when Caelin handed him the fractured chisel. He turned it over, breath catching at the twin maker's marks—dwarf and dragon, working as one.\n\n\"By the old forges,\" he whispered. \"This... this is going to shut some very loud people up.\"\n\n\"Use it well,\" Caelin said.\n\nVex hung back a half step, letting relief show only in how her knives went away without being asked. She straightened too fast; pain shot through her ribs. She swallowed the sound. Thornik noticed anyway and shifted his pack off his right shoulder so she wouldn't have to take the wind on her bad side.\n\nNyxara's eyes moved across faces, counting. \"Not everyone,\" she said, soft for her.\n\nNo one answered. The mountain had already said it.\n\nFrom the stone's long throat, distant and patient and impossible to place: thud. Thud. Thud. The Seal's count resumed, indifferent to daylight.\n\nSerana let the moment last exactly as long as it could bear and not a blink more. \"We move. Millbrook is three days. Rest, resupply, information. Then we plan.\"\n\n\"What do we plan?\" Thornik asked, though he knew.\n\n\"To finish what we started,\" she said. \"To make it mean something.\"\n\nThey turned down-slope, six where there had been seven, the east wind combing the cliff grass into silver.\n\nHalf a switchback below, Vex paused, head canted to the wind. \"Don't look now,\" she said lightly, \"but we have admirers.\"\n\nThornik followed her line. Far down the face, where the scree ran like a river, a single figure crested a rib of stone.\n\nToo still. Too patient. Even at distance, something about its silhouette felt WRONG—the way it held itself, the way it didn't shift weight like living things do.\n\nIt watched.\n\nThen it stepped backward—not turning, just REVERSING—and was gone.\n\n\"Scouts,\" Serana said, voice flat. Not afraid. Accounting.\n\n\"Distant,\" Vex confirmed, hand already on a dagger hilt. \"For now.\"\n\n\"Then we take the gift of distance,\" Serana said, and set them moving again.\n\nThey left the mountain to its long arithmetic—counting, waiting, patient as chains—and followed a narrower math: miles to town, hours to water, steps to sleep.\n\nBehind them, the Forge Road's cave mouth went back to being rock. The junction chambers settled into their new geometry. And somewhere vast and deep, something chained counted heartbeats that weren't its own.\n\nThud.\n\nThud.\n\nThud.\n\nAhead, the sky was very blue and very cruel and very free.\n\n\n\nEND CHAPTER 7\n\n\n\nWord Count: ~18,400 words",

The air changed first—thin cold bleeding into crisp, pine-sweet breath with a mineral bite from distant streams. Lichen-glow gave way to frost-silvered scrub; then the path stitched itself through scattered firs and the soil began to smell like earth again instead of old stone.\n\n\"Millbrook's the closest roof that won't fall on us,\" Thornik said, voice low, practical. \"Temple wards, a licensed healer, and a smith who won't insult my beard. We get clean water, mended kit, and news.\"\n\nSerana nodded without looking back. \"Temple first. Water second. Decisions after.\" Her tone made it an order and a prayer at once.\n\nCaelin said nothing. The scale in his forearm had settled to a coal-glow—steady, sullen heat that throbbed in time with his heartbeat. The lattice of ember-filaments ached like overworked muscle, a constant message written under the skin: Still here. Still costing. He walked with his right arm close to his side, conserving everything he could, counting steps when thoughts tried to circle the collapse.\n\nNyxara kept pace a little behind and to his left, favoring her ankle. She wore her gloves again, black leather cut close, immaculate despite the miles. She didn't explain. She never did. The gloves stayed, and no one in the world needed the sight hidden beneath them.\n\nDurgan took rearguard. The shadow at his boots behaved—mostly. Every so often it stretched a finger's width too far toward the path they'd just walked, as if reaching back for the mountain's darkness; each time his jaw tightened and it went flat again. When a trickle of red touched his upper lip he wiped it away on a dark sleeve and kept moving. No one commented. Maybe they didn't see. Maybe they pretended not to.\n\nVex moved quiet at the flank, her shoulder bound high and tight under her cloak. She spared her right arm, used her left to balance on the scree. Her breath ghosted in the cold. She didn't complain. She never did either.\n\nSomewhere far behind, the mountain gave a last, reluctant echo: thud… thud… The sound thinned with every switchback, not nearer or farther so much as fainter—like a heartbeat heard through a wall you were walking away from.\n\n\n\nThe Spring\n\nThey found a spring where the path shouldered under a shelf of granite, water humming through old ironweed and moss. It smelled clean—green-cold and metallic—and the relief of it stole conversation from their mouths.\n\nThey drank. Washed dust from faces and hands. No one went for wounds until they'd filled skins; old habits, soldier's habits.\n\nThe healer's words from another life, another town, rose uninvited in Caelin's mind: \"Not the same as your druid.\" He could almost hear Elowen laugh at that. He pressed his lips to the waterskin and swallowed the ache down with the cold. The scale warmed in answer, as if approving the discipline of silence over words.\n\n\"Two hours to the treeline,\" Thornik said, consulting a sweat-curled page from his grandfather's journal. \"Four to Millbrook if the track holds.\"\n\n\"Make it three,\" Vex said, squinting downhill. \"Smoke over the flats. Small plumes. Breakfast fires or too many chimneys for a village that size.\"\n\n\"Refugees,\" Serana said. Not a question.\n\nThey moved on.\n\n\n\nApproach: Treeline\n\nThe path widened under trees, frost giving way to the sharp sweetness of crushed needles and the tannin breath of bark warmed by a weak sun. Birds stitched sound into the branches—nervous, thin. Civilization announced itself in small ways: a cut fencepost with fresh tool-marks; a snare hanging empty and forgotten; wheel ruts pressed pale into the hard ground.\n\n\"Closest warded town means closest news,\" Thornik added, half to himself as he walked. \"We need a read on the valleys. If the corruption's pushed this far south, Depth—\" He stopped himself, glancing at Caelin, then at Serana. \"We'll have choices to make.\"\n\n\"We will,\" Serana said. She didn't say when I can hear Her again. She didn't say if.\n\nNyxara's gaze flicked to Caelin's hand. \"How's the fire?\"\n\n\"Here.\" He flexed his fingers. The lattice answered with a thread of heat and a bruise-deep throb. \"Manageable.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She let the subject die, the way a person did when the answer didn't change the plan.\n\nThe last of the mountain's voice fell away behind them—no more stone-deep thudding, only the hush of needles and the quiet complaint of boots. When the trees broke at a low saddle, the land opened like a held breath: fields winter-bare, the river flashing dull pewter to the east, and on a rise beyond, a palisade and a scatter of roofs.\n\nMillbrook.\n\nSmoke ribbons lifted from within the walls, not frantic, not yet. A bell clanged once in the distance; not alarm. A call to market, or prayer, or inventory.\n\n\"Temple. Water. Healer. Smith.\" Serana looked down the slope. \"And someone who can tell us what the valley knows.\"\n\n\"Captain on the gate'll do,\" Vex said, scanning the wall-walk. \"If he's half-awake.\"\n\nDurgan's shadow reached a hair's breadth past his heel like a dog testing a leash. He stepped forward and it obeyed, flat again, obedient for now.\n\nCaelin adjusted the strap on his pack with his left hand. The right stayed close, heat-shadows flickering under the skin where the scale lived. He told the pain the same thing he'd told it all morning: later. He told the grief: later.\n\nThey started down toward the east gate and the promise of a town that might—just might—hold a night's peace.",

                "text": "Act II — The East Gate of Millbrook\n\n\n\nThey reached the east palisade as the market bell faded. Archers watched from the walk, bows half-drawn; on the ground, six spear-bearers braced like nails hammered into the mud. Millbrook smelled of wet leather, woodsmoke, and too many bodies jammed behind timber walls.\n\n\"State your business,\" called a man in a plain breastplate with the posture of someone who'd slept in armor all week. Weather-browned face, scar at the jaw hinge, eyes that missed very little.\n\nSerana stepped forward, gauntlet lifted so her order's sigil—sunburst over scales—caught the light. \"Serana Valeblade, ordained paladin. Refugees from Thornwick ruins. We bring warning, and swords.\"\n\nHis gaze flicked from the sigil to her stance, to the party's weapons, back to her eyes. He made a decision you could hear in his breath. \"Captain Vale,\" he said. \"We're short on courage and long on problems. Gates open.\"\n\nThe twin leaves thudded back. They entered into a corridor of sharpened logs and boiled leather—murder-hole roof overhead, oil stink in the slats. Precaution had a smell here: tallow, pitch, and anxious sweat.\n\nVale fell in beside Serana as they walked, not quite deferential but close. \"Order sigils carry ward-rights in this province. I'll keep muster and law, but if you're taking the line, my guard will pivot to your shield-wall. Agreed?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Serana said. No hesitation. No flourish. Command clicked into place with the ease of a habit she was scared she'd lost.\n\n\n\nInside the Walls\n\nMillbrook had doubled itself in a week. Cart wheels stacked against sheds; laundry lines slung across alleys; a stew of accents where there should have been one. Children stared at the weapons with the dry-eyed calm of people who had run too far too fast.\n\nVale walked them along the palisade. \"Pressure from the north trace,\" he said, tapping weak spots as they passed. \"Sporadic, but learning. Refugees say fire first, then the shadow-things. We hold after dark with lantern patrols and salt-lines across the lanes. Won't hold forever.\"\n\nThornik ran a hand over a gate hinge worn shiny with worry. \"That pin's about to shear.\" He fished in his coat, then stopped, thumb finding only leather. A brief count across his harness—empty sockets where devices should be. His mouth thinned. \"I can brace it for now. Proper fix later.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" Vale said. \"I don't care if it looks ugly, I care if it swings.\"\n\nThornik hauled out a smith's hammer—old, honest steel—and set to work, the ring of metal carrying like a small prayer. He didn't explain the empty harness; the emptiness explained itself.\n\nNyxara drifted peripheral to the conversation, gloves immaculate, hood shadowing her expression. She moved like someone who understood attention was a currency and spent none of it here.\n\nDurgan hung on the tail of the tour, silent sentinel. When a thin red line started at his nostril he turned his head and wiped it away on the black of his sleeve, the mark vanishing into cloth and shadow. Vale didn't notice. Or pretended not to. Good captains chose their moments.\n\n\n\nHealer's House\n\n\"Your Ember-bearer looks rung out,\" Vale said, practical. \"Our licensed sawbones kept two caravans alive last month. Temple's down the hill if you'd rather sermons than stitches.\"\n\n\"Both,\" Serana said. \"Healer first.\"\n\nThe healer's house tasted of boiled herbs and bitter bark; bundles dried from the rafters like wind-bell chimes. A woman with iron-gray hair and the narrow hands of her craft waved Caelin to a stool and prodded gently around the black-gleam scale in his forearm.\n\n\"Tell me what you've been using for the pain,\" she said, businesslike.\n\n\"A friend,\" Caelin answered before he could edit it. \"A druid. She used to take the worst of it.\"\n\nThe healer's eyes softened a fraction. \"Not the same as your druid,\" she told him bluntly, but her touch gentled. \"I can dull the edges. Can't argue with a relic.\" She packed a poultice at the tendons, wrapped him with clean linen that smelled of willow and camphor. \"You'll breathe easier. That will have to do.\"\n\nIt did—barely. The lattice stayed hot, but the knife-edges felt further from the bone.\n\n\n\nThe Note\n\nBack on the street, Caelin re-shouldered his pack one-handed—and felt paper crinkle where there shouldn't be any. He frowned, stepped out of the lane's foot-traffic, and slid a folded square free from beneath the collar of his spare shirt.\n\nPlain, waxless, not there this morning.\n\nInside, a tight, neat hand:\n\nEmber-bearer,\n\nDepthspire wakes.\n\nTwo weeks northeast if you don't get clever.\n\nDon't be late.\n\n— L.\n\nHe showed Serana, then Vex. Vale glanced once, mind already circling town defense, and didn't pry.\n\n\"L?\" Vex said, brows up.\n\n\"Later,\" Serana decided. \"Walls first.\"\n\nCaelin tucked the note back where it had appeared. The paper felt colder than it should in his fingers. When he slid it away, the skin over the scale warmed in reply, like disagreement.\n\n\n\nMuster\n\nBy late afternoon, Vale had them on a fast circuit through Millbrook's beating heart. Serana walked the wall with him, calling positions and fall-backs; the guards took her orders without side-eye because the sigil made it law and the steadiness in her voice made it easy. Vex ghosted the lanes, mapping alleys and choke points and escape routes with a thief's pragmatism. Thornik shored the hinge with a wedge and two bolts and a prayer, then started cataloguing where scrap iron could be made into stakes. Durgan stayed paired with a lantern-man at the western walk; the shadow at his boots behaved when looked at and misbehaved when not, which was the nature of certain problems. Nyxara vanished for an hour and returned with dried ink at the edge of her glove and a scent of old vellum—wherever she'd gone, it had books and wards and a keeper who owed her a favor.\n\nAs the sun slid, Vale faced Serana at the inner gate. \"We drill the bells at dusk,\" he said. \"If you've got a better line, I'll take it.\"\n\nSerana's jaw flexed like she wanted to pray and couldn't find where to put the words. \"We hold the market square,\" she said instead. \"Light, angles, lanes. We make them come to us.\"\n\nVale nodded once. \"Right. I'll put the green boys on the left, veterans at the well. Your people anchor the street from the mill. We answer your calls.\" He glanced at the sigil again, then at her eyes. \"Try not to get us killed, Paladin.\"\n\n\"I'll do what I can,\" she said. It was almost a joke and almost a vow.",

                "text": "Act III — Streets and Rooms\n\n\n\nMillbrook had convinced itself of spring. Meltwater ran in narrow gullies between cobbles. Laundry pretended the wind was helpful. A cartwheel argued with a rut and lost. Normalcy stacked itself high enough to be worth falling from.\n\nThey procured soap, a length of decent rope, a handful of nails Thornik admired as if they were art, and bread with enough heat left in it to sting fingers. Caelin carried the loaf under his good arm and learned that you can remember a person with your nose as easily as any other way. Three more breaths of it and he knew exactly which market stall Elowen would have gone to first, and what she would have said to the baker, and why that was exactly the kind of thing that was going to keep ambushing him for a long time.\n\n\n\nQuiet Rooms\n\nNyxara asked Vale for \"a door that locks and a basin that doesn't leak.\" He gave her a narrow cell behind the archive. She closed the bolt and peeled her gloves off in the shadowed light—flesh blackened at the fingertips where death-magic had taken its rent. Linen. Oil. The practiced ritual of binding and unbinding. Not performance; maintenance. Out of sight because sometimes strength is simply privacy.\n\nBy the time she reemerged, the gloves were back on, immaculate as always, and no one had been invited to pity.\n\n\n\nA Healer's Word\n\nCaelin's new bandage smelled of willow and camphor. The healer had done what she could: dulled the edges, steadied his breath. \"Not the same as your druid,\" she'd said, and he hadn't asked how she knew—because he'd told her, softly, before he could stop himself. Elowen's name didn't cross his lips; it didn't have to. The ache made a name of its own.\n\nOn the walk back, Vex paced him without comment. When his step hitched on a pothole, her hand shot out and steadied his elbow as if she hadn't meant to. She let go just as quickly, pretending she hadn't.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\n\"Watch your feet,\" she replied, sharpening the words to hide the softness inside them.\n\n\n\nThe Copper Ladle\n\nMillbrook's main tavern wore its age in grooves on the floorboards and soot in the rafters. The Copper Ladle's low ceiling trapped smoke and noise in equal measure. Refugees packed the benches, their conversations a blend of fear and forced normalcy. Vale took the corner bench with Serana to walk the defensive map again; Vex ghosted to a column with clear sight of both doors; Durgan planted himself by the back exit and watched shadows decide if they wanted to misbehave.\n\nCaelin shouldered through the press toward an empty table, the scale's heat making his arm ache worse in the crowded warmth.\n\n\"The Ember-born.\" The voice was silk over steel, carrying easily over the tavern's din. \"Fortune smiles—I'd begun to worry you'd take another route entirely.\"\n\nThe speaker rose from a corner table with practiced grace—dark hair, amber eyes that catalogued everything, expensive leather armor that looked effortlessly casual. Maps and journals spread before him like a merchant's wares, a bottle of Stormhaven red already half-empty. Five cups waited with the patience of a man accustomed to getting his way.\n\n\"Jasper Coinblight, at your considerable service.\" He gestured to the empty chairs with a flourish that somehow didn't look theatrical. \"Information broker, relic hunter, and—if the cards fall favorably—your guide to wealth beyond imagining. Please, do sit. The wine is exceptional, the company promises to be memorable, and the conversation will be worth considerably more than both.\"\n\nVex's hand drifted toward a dagger hilt. \"You've been waiting for us specifically.\"\n\n\"Waiting implies passivity. I prefer 'strategically positioned along probable routes.'\" Jasper's smile could have charmed coin from a miser's purse. \"When the dragon-marked and his remarkable companions depart Thornwick heading east, certain destinations become statistically likely. And statistics, my dear shadow-dancer, are simply opportunities wearing numbers.\"\n\nCaelin felt the scale pulse steady—no white-hot sting of deception. Whatever else this man was, he believed his own silver tongue.\n\n\"You know where we're going,\" Serana said. Not a question.\n\n\"I know where you must go.\" Jasper spread his maps across the table with the reverence of a priest laying out scripture. \"Depthspire. The Concord's most ambitious prison-vault, and quite possibly their most catastrophically brilliant mistake.\"\n\nHe traced elegant fingers across the largest map. \"Picture, if you will, a fortress designed not merely to store treasures, but to defend them using the very monsters too dangerous to kill. Corrupted mages. Possessed warriors. Things that slipped through conjuration rifts and refused to die politely. The Concord imprisoned them alongside their most valuable relics and artifacts.\"\n\n\"Using prisoners as guards?\" Thornik's scholarly interest overrode his caution.\n\n\"As a living security system.\" Jasper's eyes gleamed. \"Adaptive, intelligent, and utterly motivated. Each prisoner positioned between entrance and vault, each one desperate for freedom and quite willing to kill anyone foolish enough to offer the opportunity.\" He paused for effect. \"Brilliance and horror in equal measure, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n\"Three entrances,\" Jasper continued, tapping locations. \"East—heavily guarded by what remains of the prison's original wardens. Inadvisable. South—flooded for decades, structurally unsound. Suicidal. West—the deep prison levels where, curiously enough, the wards are failing and certain occupied cells are beginning to open.\"\n\nCaelin's scale warmed at that. \"The doors are opening?\"\n\n\"Indeed. And here's where your particular destiny intersects with my professional aspirations.\" Jasper leaned forward, all business now despite the smooth delivery. \"As the Nine relics awaken—as that remarkable scale of yours came alive—the binding magic weakens. The prisoners are stirring. Some cells have already failed. The dungeon becomes more dangerous every day.\"\n\n\"But also more accessible,\" Vex finished, understanding dawning.\n\n\"Precisely.\" Jasper's smile acknowledged her sharp mind. \"You must traverse all three levels to reach the vault itself. One relic waits there—a piece of your grand puzzle. Plus sufficient treasures to fund, oh, a dozen expeditions.\" He spread his hands. \"What I'm proposing is a partnership of enlightened self-interest.\"\n\n\"You want a share,\" Vex said flatly.\n\n\"I want to survive long enough to spend it.\" Jasper met her mismatched eyes without flinching. \"I've researched Depthspire for three years. I know the approach, the architecture, the legends. More importantly, I have an associate whose particular talents make him utterly invaluable for what we're attempting.\"\n\n\"What kind of associate?\" Serana asked carefully.\n\nJasper's smile turned enigmatic. \"The kind the Copper Ladle refuses to serve. Something about rats and smell.\" He stood smoothly. \"But words do him disservice—you should meet him yourselves. He's waiting outside, as taverns have become rather inhospitable to his unique charms.\"\n\nHe moved toward the door, then paused. \"Fair warning: Puddle is an acquired taste. But he possesses skills that will mean the difference between reaching that vault and becoming another cautionary tale.\" His amber eyes held something that might have been genuine respect. \"One week. West entrance. Don't be late—the dungeon doesn't improve with age.\"\n\n\n\nOutside in the Alley\n\nThe alley was dark, narrow, smelling of rain-soaked wood and old barrel rot. Jasper led them around the tavern's side where shadows pooled thick.\n\n\"Puddle?\" he called. \"Our potential associates have agreed to an introduction.\"\n\nMovement along the wall—something scuttling with unsettling fluidity.\n\nA figure emerged from the shadows.\n\nSmall. Barely five feet tall, hunched beneath a tattered dark cloak that looked like it had been stitched from a dozen different rags. Greenish skin caught the moonlight, and a broad, almost manic grin split his face, showing prominent teeth. Oversized eyes gleamed with cheerful intensity beneath the hood. Multiple pouches hung from a belt alongside small cages—some occupied by small, squeaking shapes. He gripped a gnarled walking stick, and perched on his shoulders, tucked into pockets, one even nestled in his hood—\n\n\"Hello! Puddle is Puddle! And these are Puddle's friends!\" The half-orc gestured proudly to the rats with his free hand, the movement making them adjust positions with practiced ease.\n\nThe smell arrived a heartbeat later: earthy, musty, cheese, underground.\n\n\"Too bright out here. Puddle prefers dark. Dark is safe! Lights make Puddles squinty!\"\n\n\"Puddle Thrym,\" Jasper introduced smoothly. \"The finest tunnel-runner, dungeon-mapper, and all-around subterranean specialist currently breathing.\"\n\nPuddle beamed at the praise. \"Fire-mark! Metal-beard! Shiny-paladin! Dark-lady! Pretty-knife-lady! Quiet-man-with-funny-shadow!\" He'd named them all instantly, head tilting at each in turn.\n\n\"Your... friends?\" Caelin asked carefully, gesturing toward the rats.\n\n\"Yes! Puddle's friends are very helpful!\" One of the rats—grey-brown with intelligent eyes—chittered at length. Puddle listened intently, nodding. \"Whiskers is very wise! Whiskers says Fire-mark smells like fire and old magic!\"\n\nHe tilted his head at Caelin, concerned. \"And... sadness? Why Fire-mark sad? Is Puddle's smell? Puddle can stand farther away!\"\n\n\"It's not your smell,\" Vex said, something almost gentle in her tone despite the absurdity of the conversation.\n\nPuddle brightened immediately. \"Good! Puddle works very hard on smell! Many years of sewer-living!\"\n\n\"Puddle's companions,\" Jasper explained with the patience of long practice, \"possess talents that conventional scouts lack. They can navigate spaces no human could access. And most crucially—they can map dungeons with remarkable accuracy.\"\n\n\"Friends go where big people can't! Friends see what big people miss! Puddle finds secret ways! Small tunnels! Drainage! Places metal-crushers don't see!\" His enthusiasm was infectious, despite the strangeness.\n\n\"Metal-crushers?\" Thornik asked.\n\n\"Big metal things that patrol,\" Puddle said matter-of-factly, then reached into one of his pouches and withdrew something small and dried. \"Puddle brings gift to celebrate partnership! Is very fresh jerky! Only died this morning!\"\n\nMoonlight caught it clearly: unmistakably rat-shaped.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Serana said immediately.\n\n\"Hard pass,\" Vex added.\n\nPuddle shrugged cheerfully and ate it himself, the crunch audible. \"More for Puddle then!\"\n\nJasper's smooth mask cracked into a genuine smile. \"As I said—acquired taste.\" He turned serious again. \"One week. West entrance. Puddle can map the dungeon as we go—find routes around the worst dangers, locate passages others would miss entirely.\"\n\n\"And if we decide this is suicide?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Then I'll find someone else who values the difference between 'impossible' and 'merely extraordinarily dangerous.'\" Jasper's amber eyes held calculation and something like respect. \"But I don't believe you will. You're heading to the Emberpeaks regardless—Depthspire is the only intact Concord structure in that range. The question isn't if you'll need us, but whether you'll be wise enough to accept the help before attempting it blind.\"\n\nPuddle produced a clay bottle from another pouch. \"Puddle has mushroom wine for celebrating! Makes tongue fuzzy! Very fun!\"\n\n\"No,\" came the immediate collective response.\n\n\"Suit yourselves.\" Jasper clapped Puddle's shoulder. \"Come along, my aromatic friend. We have preparations to make.\"\n\nPuddle waved cheerfully to the party, rats chittering in what might have been farewell. \"One week! West entrance! Puddle will be ready!\"\n\nHe grinned that broad, manic grin. \"Dark is better for traveling anyway!\"\n\nThe two disappeared into the barrel-shadows—Jasper's smooth grace and Puddle's hunched, scuttling gait. Distant squeaking faded into silence.\n\nThe party stood for a long moment.\n\n\"We're trusting our lives to that?\" Thornik said faintly.\n\n\"If we go,\" Caelin corrected. He looked back toward the warm light of the tavern. \"Right now we have a council to prepare for and a town to help hold.\"",

Captain Vale returned with a sister from the chapel, two gray-haired locals who looked like wheat had opinions, and someone who tried and failed not to be a clerk.\n\nThey asked sane questions. What had they seen? How far had the glass spread? Were there other survivors? The sister's eyes darted to Serana's insignia, then away. The clerk wrote as if ink could keep anyone safe.\n\nCaelin told the truth that would fit in a room. Thornik explained what he could without calling it worship. Vex left out every detail that would make anyone braver than they had a right to be. Durgan did not speak. Nyxara smiled when it helped. Serana's jaw clenched on old oaths and found no purchase.\n\nWhen it ended, Vale gave them the look of a man who knows there are wolves in the hills and has just learned they can climb fences. \"There'll be talk,\" he said. \"About Ember-born. About what you carry. It would be better if you didn't show it.\"\n\nCaelin tugged his sleeve down. \"Agreed.\"\n\nAfter they left, the inn felt older. The fiddle found its tuning. Someone sang a work song about rivers taking what they wanted. The room joined in because it knew how.\n\nAt the edge of the hearth's circle, Serana bowed her head over a bowl of stew gone cold and shaped her hands for prayer without speaking. Nothing came. No warmth, no direction, no sense of a presence at the other end of the gesture. After a while, she un-shaped her hands and ate mechanically. Caelin pretended not to see and succeeded the way men do when kindness would break something.\n\nElowen should have been here to complain about the taste of boiled fat. She would have catalogued it specifically: the grade of tallow, the wrong herbs, what the cook should have done differently. She would have complained with enough precision that it became funny. Caelin lifted his spoon and the scale warmed once like memory finding a handhold and let go.\n\nNight came down easy, which only meant it would be harder in the morning.",

When the room thinned to a few drunks and quiet chairs, Caelin joined him with two cups of water that steamed in the inn's honest heat.\n\n\"Quieter than the mountain,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Quieter makes men loud,\" Durgan said.\n\nThey sat in silence that had weight but not weapon. Outside, wind ran along the eaves. Somewhere a dog argued with a dream. The inn's stones breathed retained heat like a stored prayer no one believed in anymore.\n\n\"The mark,\" Durgan said without looking, \"does it ache or warn?\"\n\n\"Tonight? Neither. It listens.\" He flexed his fingers. \"It likes places with rules.\"\n\n\"Walls,\" Durgan said.\n\n\"Rooms. Schedules.\" Caelin half-smiled. \"Dinner at the same hour. The world pretending it can be persuaded.\"\n\nDurgan nodded. \"Don't let it teach you to trust that.\"\n\n\"You trust anything?\"\n\n\"Weight,\" Durgan said. \"And whether a rope's been kept dry.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—no color, just pressure—when a gust slipped under the door, bringing a breath of cold that remembered stone. Caelin put his palm flat on the table and steadied his own hum until it fell back to a human rhythm. No one else noticed. He preferred it that way.\n\nWhen he rose to wake Thornik for second watch, Durgan said, \"You kept moving when the rock wanted you to stop. Keep doing that.\" It was the closest the man came to comfort. It fit.\n\nUpstairs, Vex snored very carefully—quiet enough to deny it later. Thornik mumbled a formula in his sleep that resolved into the word stay. Serana lay on her back watching the ceiling as if it might answer, then turned and didn't ask. Caelin lay awake longer than he meant to, waiting for a hum that didn't come.\n\nThe town held through the night. The mountain did not call. Perhaps it was busy elsewhere. That was worse.",

The inn's hearth was already working on a gruel it called porridge. Vex declared it a war crime and ate two bowls.\n\nCaptain Vale waited near the door with the politeness of a man who doesn't like his own orders. \"Council wants you at midday.\" He hesitated. \"There's been talk. Traders on the south road swore they saw a light under the clouds. Not lightning. Steadier.\"\n\n\"Depthspire,\" Thornik said reflexively, then drank his tea as if that might hide the word. It didn't.\n\n\"Is that where you're going?\" Vale asked.\n\n\"We go where the pull goes,\" Caelin said, which was both non-answer and truth. \"After your council.\" He nodded toward the street. \"And after we help you fix the gate hinge that's going to break in the next strong wind.\"\n\nVale blinked. \"You saw that?\"\n\n\"Weight leaves signatures,\" Caelin said. \"Even on wood.\"\n\nThey spent an hour with Thornik at the gate: rope, a lever, a lesson in the faith of simple machines. Serana steadied the ladder without praying. Durgan held the hinge while two men hammered the pin through; no one asked how he made the weight look like it belonged there. Vex found the copper the girl-captain had taxed from Durgan yesterday and left it on the sill of a window with a broken pane.\n\nBy late morning, rumor had grown legs and a voice and moved faster than truth. The council hall filled with people who pretended to be calm about it. Vale walked them in as if they were contraband and good news.\n\nCaelin pulled his sleeve down again and let the scale stay dark. The pull inside him had gentled to a low thrum, patient as a debt. When he glanced north, the light through the windows had the color of cooled iron. Somewhere in that direction, a tower remembered being a wound.\n\n\"Ready?\" Vex asked, meaning for the council, meaning for whatever used to be a world.\n\n\"No,\" Caelin said. \"But I'm going anyway.\"\n\nThey crossed the threshold together.

Children were shooed under cellar hatches that smelled of earth, turnips, and fear. On the lane, chalk marks glowed faint in lantern light—Serana's secular ward-lines. Here hold. Here yield. Fall back to square at second bell. The guard captain's voice ran along the wall: \"Steady on—by files—mind your spacing.\"\n\nThey listened because of the charter-sigil on Serana's cloak and because Vale said \"Do it,\" and Vale had been telling them what to do for twelve winters and they were still alive.\n\nWind carried the wrong smell: damp stone, old iron, something like cold breath blown through a keyhole. Then the first of the shadow-thralls stepped out from behind the butcher's, bending wrong at the knee.\n\n\"Hold until I call,\" Serana said, shield lifting, voice level. Her light flickered—she made it steady with will alone.\n\nVale moved along the line like a man checking knots before a storm. \"Spears up. Eyes forward. When the paladin calls, you move. Not before.\"\n\nHe stopped at a boy of perhaps sixteen—spear too long, knuckles white on the haft. Vale squared the angle with one hand, said nothing. Then, quieter than the line needed to hear: \"You showed up. That's the part most men don't manage.\" He moved on.\n\n\n\nThe party split to assignments with the efficiency of people who'd learned to trust each other's competence even when they didn't trust each other.\n\nThornik took the wall, tool-harness mostly empty but hands steady on his axes. He touched the loops where charges used to nest—six left, maybe seven. He'd counted three times. \"Make them count,\" he muttered to no one.\n\nVex ghosted to the tower stairs, testing her wrapped shoulder with a roll that pulled but held. Another week and she'd forget it had been cut. For now, she'd just have to be faster.\n\nCaelin held the center near the square, right arm bound tight under his sleeve. The scale pulsed coal-glow—manageable, steady. He flexed his fingers. Pain sang through the lattice but didn't scream. He could work with that.\n\nNyxara took position at the gate, gloves immaculate, face calm. Her fingers had stiffened through the day but still flexed when she needed them to. Still worked. That would have to be enough.\n\nDurgan moved to the bucket-line's edge, blades loose in their sheaths, shadow obedient at his boots in the lantern-glow. For now.\n\nThe thralls came on too quiet.",

The silhouettes buckled as anatomy demanded; their shadows whipped, failing to find purchase against Serana's ward-line.\n\n\"On me!\" Serana barked, stepping to take a rake meant for a baker at the bucket line. Something stirred at her shoulder—habit, reflex—guttered before it could hold. She put her body between the blow and the question and did not flinch.\n\nThornik thumbed a charge and skipped it off the cobbles; it caromed under three thralls and went off with a shuddering cough of light and sound. One collapsed. Two more staggered, smoking.\n\n\"Five left,\" he grunted, already counting.\n\nDurgan's blades worked short and economical, every cut a lesson. His shadow dragged at him slightly, wanting, but he crushed it flat with jaw-locked effort and felt the warm trickle of a nosebleed vanish into the black of his collar. No one saw.\n\nCaelin kept center, throwing small heat—lines on steel, a melted hinge, a slick made glassy at the right instant. Pain flared, then steadied. Manageable.\n\n\n\nA scream cut through the chaos—civilian down in the square, leg twisted wrong.\n\nA voice cut through the noise—not a shout, a command, the kind that had been obeyed on fields worse than this: \"Don't move him! Spine's compromised!\"\n\nCaelin turned. A man knelt over the fallen villager—grey-bearded, built like two decades of campaign work that had never quite softened, hands moving with the unhurried speed of someone who'd stopped being surprised by injury somewhere around middle age. Battered medical bag, open on bloody cobbles. He didn't look up.\n\n\"You.\" This at a woman nearby. \"Neck brace. My bag. Green strap.\" Then to the wounded man, in the gentler voice of a carpenter addressing a split beam: \"You're going to live. I've pulled men through worse than this with less. The bad news is you're going to remember it.\" Then to Caelin, still not looking up: \"Are you bleeding?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then step aside. I have a limited amount of time and an unlimited amount of injured people.\"\n\nCaelin blinked, then grabbed a dropped spear and handed it to a shaking boy who needed something to hold more than he needed direction. When he looked back, the man had already moved to the next patient.\n\nLater, during a lull, he watched him splint a broken leg with a spear-shaft and someone's belt.\n\n\"Good news,\" the man told the screaming patient. \"You'll live. You'll walk with a limp that'll get you out of digging latrine pits for the rest of your natural life. In my experience that's a net positive.\"\n\nThe thralls retreated like smoke pulled backward through cracks.\n\nSecond bell rang.\n\n\"Fall back to the square!\" Vale's shout carried like a thrown rope. \"Mill Lane! Paladin—anchor!\"\n\n\"We're there,\" Serana answered, already moving.",

Villagers braced spears with white knuckles; Vale ran the line, tapping shoulders, fixing spacing, making fear into formation.\n\n\"Reserve on the right,\" he told a sergeant. \"When the paladin gives you the nod, you move. No heroics. We live.\"\n\nThe thralls came hard now, shadows flaring like oil under wind.\n\n\"Thornik!\" Vex called from the parapet. \"Left!\"\n\nHe burned two charges to break a rush that would have folded the line. The belt went lighter at his ribs. He tapped the emptiness with a grim snort. \"Three left. Then it's axes and prayer.\"\n\nNyxara was cool and surgical—veils of suggestion and stutters of hesitation blooming in enemy minds, buying heartbeats where heartbeats meant survival. She did not reach for the deeper well yet. Not yet.\n\nCaelin pushed harder. A spearline of red-gold leapt from his palm and cut a corridor through grasping shadows; a second cast flared broader, washing the cobbles clean for the bucket line to move. The lattice screamed inside his skin. He tasted copper. He did it anyway.\n\n\"Hold!\" Serana called, catching a blow on the boss of her shield that would have broken a door. Her light flickered. She made it burn. \"Hold—!\"\n\nThe line bent. It did not break.\n\nThen three thralls slipped the ward seam Vex was guarding.\n\nShe cut one's knee, hamstrung the second, rolled under the third and took its throat clean—then a fourth she hadn't seen came in low. The butt of its spear caught her temple. The world went sideways.\n\n\"Vex!\" Thornik shouted, trying to cut across, but the line surged to fill the gap and he was a beat too slow.\n\nCaelin turned and saw her folded at an angle wrong for living things.\n\nSomething in him broke open.\n\nHe screamed.\n\nFire answered.\n\nNot careful. Not neat. A blast-front roared across half the square, a dragon's exhale made narrow by brutal will. Thralls ignited in a red-gold bloom; their shadows screamed and fled like ink in boiling water. The nearest barrels scorched; bucket-men fell back with singed hair and wide eyes.\n\nPain tore him hollow. The lattice lit with searing white, every filament a wire pulled too taut. For a heartbeat he thought the scale would split his arm from the inside.\n\nHe stumbled through the heat he'd made, fell to his knees beside Vex.\n\nPulse—where was her pulse—\n\nThere. Thready. There.\n\nFootsteps. The old man dropped beside him, fingers already at Vex's throat, checking pupils with a thumb that forced her eyelid up with zero ceremony.\n\n\"Concussion. Head trauma. Broken rib.\" He started wrapping with brutal efficiency. \"Touch and go.\"\n\nCaelin's throat closed. \"Will she—\"\n\n\"Don't know yet.\" No false comfort. Just bandages pulled tight. \"Keep her breathing. Keep her still. That's all we can do right now.\"\n\nThe man looked up at Caelin's arm, at the scale visible under blood-stained bandages. \"Did you just scream fire across a battlefield?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Objectively terrifying.\" He tied off the wrap. \"Also, thank you. She'd be dead without it.\"\n\nHe stood, moved to the next wounded, didn't look back.\n\nCaelin stayed beside Vex, one hand near hers, counting breaths.\n\nMovement—wrong, close. A thrall's shadow reached toward his shoulder.\n\nHe had to move or die.\n\nHe stood through the pain and turned back into the fight.",

Vale went to meet them.\n\nHe fought like a man who'd practiced near a thousand nights for this one—no wasted motion, no glory in it. He put his body where the line was thinnest and made it thick again. He looked toward Serana once; she nodded once; there was understanding.\n\nWhen the spear came from the side—slick black, more spike than wood—he shoved a boy out of its path and took it clean through the ribs. He finished his stroke anyway, pinned one more shadow-thing to the stones, refused to fall until falling would close the gap he'd held.\n\n\"On me,\" he said once, voice wet, and the reserve swung like a gate because he'd taught them to hear that tone and obey it.\n\nSerana saw him go. Her jaw set. \"Hold,\" she said, softer, as if she could make the word a covering.\n\nThe old man reached him first, dropped beside him, hands already moving to assess the wound. Stopped. The spear had gone through cleanly, and what it carried in its wake was already spreading—corruption, wrongness, the kind of wound no bandage could fix.\n\n\"I can fix broken,\" he said, voice tight with the particular frustration of a craftsman given an impossible job. \"I can't fix this.\"\n\nHe met Vale's eyes—still clear, still present—and understood. Covered his face with clean cloth when it was done, stood, moved to the next patient who could be saved.\n\nThornik roared in Dwarvish and split a thrall at the collarbone. The shock of the blow traveled up his arms and lit old breaks; he kept swinging.\n\nDurgan moved like a grim machine. Once, his shadow pulled toward the enemy's at the corners of light—just a heartbeat, just enough to notice. He forced it flat and cut what needed cutting. Blood ran from his nose again; the collar caught it.\n\nNyxara finally reached down to the place she'd been avoiding.\n\nShe whispered in a language that wasn't spoken so much as remembered; frost formed along the lintels; breath smoked. Something stepped up out of absence at her call—a hound built of rib-bones and blue witchlight, eyes like lanterns in fog.\n\n\"Fetch,\" she told it, voice steady. It went without hesitation and broke a thrall at the knees with a crack like a branch under ice.\n\nA corpse behind the barricade rose at her second word—its face wrapped in a strip of sackcloth she tied without flinching. It fought for them, clumsy, obedient, and bought four lives before it fell again.\n\nThe price walked into her hands. The gloves hid the color change, but she felt fingertips go colder, deader, one joint beginning to separate where tendon met bone. She bound that knowledge behind a perfect expression and kept working.",

Her shield slammed into a leader's chest; the line stepped; the reserve flowed; the square held.\n\nAnd then—like a thread cut—the thralls began to break.\n\nThey did not run so much as fold and vanish, remnants sinking back into cracks they had no right to fit.\n\nSilence arrived the way it always does after a fight that large: not as absence but as presence, a new thing settling over the square with weight. The moaning and dripping and the meaningless roll of a loose bucket across cobblestones—all of it still there, all of it somehow part of the silence rather than breaking it. The kind of quiet that means there is nothing left to kill and your body hasn't learned that yet.\n\nCaelin's arm was a column of white heat from shoulder to wrist. He became aware, slowly, that he was still holding a fighting stance and made himself lower it. The lattice ticked and began to cool by degrees. He looked down at his hand. Still there. Still attached. That felt like more than he deserved.\n\nThornik stood with an axe in each fist and his belt empty and blood on his beard that wasn't all his own. He ran his eyes across the square the way a man counts coin—methodical, not hopeful. When he reached zero on the charge loops, he exhaled once through his nose. Then he put the axes away.\n\nDurgan went very still at the square's edge. His shadow lay flat and honest at his boots in the torchlight. He pressed the back of his wrist to his nose. Dry. He checked again. Habit. He exhaled once, slow, like a man easing a door closed so it didn't wake anyone.\n\nVex hadn't moved. She was breathing. Caelin could see it from here. That was what mattered.\n\nSilence after battle felt like a held breath finally released.\n\nThe third bell rang once, useless, telling a town that already knew to stop fighting because there was nothing left to kill.",

The smell was sweat, pitch, cooked iron, and the bitter, wrong scent the thralls left behind.\n\n\"Water on the east thatch!\" a sergeant called—Vale's echo in his voice, trying to fill a space that couldn't be filled.\n\nAldric worked in the center of the square, surrounded by wounded, hands moving with the mechanical rhythm of someone past exhaustion who has no intention of stopping. When Caelin approached, he didn't look up from wrapping a farmer's arm.\n\n\"Everyone needs a healer,\" he said. \"Get in line.\"\n\n\"She's still breathing,\" Caelin said quietly.\n\nAldric's hands stilled for just a heartbeat. \"Good. Keep it that way.\" He tied off the bandage, moved to the next patient. \"Wake me if she stops.\"\n\n\n\nThey moved bodies to the south lane and covered them with clean sheets that smelled of sun and soap. Captain Vale lay among them, his hands crossed over the spear that had saved a boy who stood ten feet away and couldn't understand why he was still standing.\n\nSerana knelt. Her light failed to gather. She prayed anyway, voice a rasp. \"Guide him. He kept his watch.\" The words landed because she said them, light or no.\n\nThornik found the hinge at the east gate had splintered under blast and weight. No one asked. He set his hammer against the bent pin and began to work the metal back true. Tap, heat, wedge. His tool-harness hung empty at his ribs, loops that should have held cleverness now just leather and air. He worked anyway, the old way, with sweat and stubbornness.\n\nNyxara did not linger in the square once the dead were counted and the living were moving. She took a narrow stair to the little room behind the archive, slid the bolt, and sat very still until the tremor in her hands stopped.\n\nThe gloves would come off later, in private. The accounting would be done where no one could see what she'd become.\n\nDurgan cleaned his blades with method that could have been prayer. His shadow lay obedient at his boots; his shoulders were too square. When the nosebleed started again, he pressed the heel of his hand to it and turned slightly so the dark cloth drank the red. He kept his eyes on Caelin across the square and told himself that standing here was still a choice he was making.\n\n\n\nCaelin found Aldric on an upturned bucket at the square's edge, stitching a cut in his own forearm with the calm of a man mending a saddle.\n\n\"You do that yourself?\" Caelin asked.\n\n\"Every time.\" Aldric bit the thread. \"Forty years of practice. You get good at it or you get dead, and I've always had a mild preference for the first option.\"\n\nCaelin crouched. \"You're not from Millbrook.\"\n\n\"No.\" Aldric rolled his sleeve down. \"Third Harrow Company, retired. Field surgeon fifteen years, then walking between towns for another ten patching whoever needed patching.\" He paused. \"I was attached to the garrison at Veln's Post when the seals started failing two years ago. Forty men. Good men, most of them—well-trained, sensible, the sort who ate their vegetables and didn't gamble more than they could lose.\" He said it with the flat affect of someone who'd had time to turn the memory into something he could carry. \"Thirty-seven of them died to something that came through the lower vault. I couldn't cut it out. Couldn't bandage it. Couldn't do a single useful thing.\"\n\n\"You survived.\"\n\n\"I was in the east tower when it happened. A healer who was somewhere else when people needed healing.\" He looked at his hands once, briefly, then didn't again. \"Since then I've been trying to get back into the plateau's border country. Find out what came through that vault. Find out if the other sealed vaults are next.\"\n\nCaelin said, carefully: \"Veln's Post is Depthspire's eastern approach.\"\n\n\"I know where it is.\"\n\nA beat. \"We're going in. North, toward Depthspire.\"\n\n\"I know what you are.\" Aldric nodded at Caelin's wrapped arm. \"Saw the mark when you were on your knees beside the woman. Knew what you were about.\" He stood, joints filing their usual complaints. \"You'll need a healer. That plateau has spent the last two years demonstrating that it can open people up in ways that don't respond well to wishful thinking.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a reason to stay away,\" Vex said from behind Caelin. He hadn't heard her cross the square.\n\n\"That's what the thirty-seven thought,\" Aldric said pleasantly, \"before they stopped having opinions.\" He looked at Vex's shoulder with the eyes of a man who'd assessed a great many wounds and was unimpressed by what he was seeing. \"That wrap needs redoing. Sit down.\"\n\nVex sat down.\n\n\n\nShe woke near midnight. Caelin was there, which she registered before she registered anything else.\n\n\"Six,\" he said, when her eyes focused. \"Before you fell. In case you were counting.\"\n\n\"Seven,\" she said. \"You missed one at the drainpipe.\"\n\nHe almost smiled. \"How's your head?\"\n\n\"Feels like someone rang it like a bell.\" She shifted, winced, settled. \"Vale?\"\n\nThe almost-smile went away. \"He saved people. We'll say his name right.\"\n\nShe was quiet a moment. Then: \"This Aldric. He any good?\"\n\n\"He stitched his own arm without flinching and told a man with a broken leg that it was a net positive. I think he'll do.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" She closed her eyes. \"Don't let him touch my shoulder again while I'm awake. He's not gentle.\"\n\n\"He said you'd say that. He said if you say that, he was right about the wrap and you can thank him later.\"\n\nVex said something short and accurate about Aldric's bedside manner and went back to sleep.\n\n\n\nNight came early, as it does after battles. Millbrook slept in ragged shifts.\n\nCaelin sat outside on the stable step and watched the sky find stars one at a time. The scale had settled lower than it had been in days—the scream-cast had burned something down to a truer level, cleared some pressure he hadn't known had been building. He flexed his fingers in the dark. The lattice answered steady and sullen, like a fire that had stopped trying to be impressive and committed to just burning.\n\nHe looked north. The scale warmed a fraction—the same direction it had been pointing since the mountain, patient as a compass needle. Somewhere out there the Depthspire aurora had written curtains across the sky. Somewhere out there L's note said two weeks. Somewhere out there thirty-seven men from Veln's Post were owed an answer.\n\nThe third bell had rung too late. Millbrook held, but Vale was gone, and the cost of holding felt heavier than the victory.\n\nHe let that sit. He wasn't going to argue with it. He let it settle beside the other things he was carrying, and then he went in to sleep in pieces, the way you do after battles, and let the north wait until morning.",

She came down the loft's shadow-ladder of the stable and stopped in the dark beneath the last rafter, away from the door. The left glove came off.\n\nShe held the hand up in the thin grey light coming through the gap in the boards. The fingertips were black to the second knuckle now. The skin had the texture of something that had been cold too long—not dead, not yet, but learning the direction. She flexed each finger in turn, feeling the nerves report from their diminished distance. Not pain exactly. More like the memory of pain, arriving late and quiet. She counted the joints. Same number as yesterday. She had stopped being grateful for that and started just counting.\n\nThe glove went back on before she stepped into the yard.\n\n\n\nShe crossed the square alone. The cobbles were still scorched in places where Caelin's fire had swept through; the barricade had been pulled aside but not yet cleared, and someone had left a bucket where a man had died. The smell of the night before hung in the cold air—pitch, iron, the strange wrong-sweetness the thralls left behind. She walked through it without slowing. She had learned early that the best way to move through a bad place was to move through it.\n\nShe found Caelin where she'd expected—on the stable step in the early cold, carefully re-wrapping his arm, testing the grip against the ache. He didn't try to stand when she approached. It would cost too much.\n\nA thumb-sized mirror-coin lay in her palm, frost veining the face from the inside.\n\n\"Summoned,\" she said. \"And I was told to tell you. You, specifically.\"\n\n\"By your patron?\" He kept his eyes on the wrap.\n\nShe tilted the coin; the frost vanished as if swallowed. \"When they call, I go. And right now I'm held together with spite and linen. If I cast like I did yesterday, I'll lose these.\" She lifted the gloved hand. He knew what was under it. \"Next time it's the hand. Then the arm.\"\n\nHe nodded once. \"Do you want me to tell the others?\"\n\n\"In a bit.\" She pressed a looped obsidian sliver into his palm. \"One breath where lies land like truth. Spend it to buy time, not fate.\"\n\nBefore he could answer, she drew out a narrow dark ribbon knotted with a hair-fine thread of silver. \"Tie it under your sleeve. If I'm within about a hundred miles, the silver will shade darker. Not a map—just nearness.\"\n\nHe studied it. \"That helps.\"\n\nShe didn't add—and he didn't ask—that the knot carried a return thread only she could read; that if she needed to find him, the ribbon answered her too.\n\n\"Anything else I should know?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only this.\" She took his wrist, quick and careful, and tied the ribbon for him beneath the wrap where it wouldn't show. \"I'm going because I must, not because I want to. And—\" her grin flashed, wicked even through exhaustion \"—try not to exhaust yourself without me. I'd hate to miss it.\"\n\nEven hurt, he huffed a laugh. \"No promises.\"\n\n\"Good boy.\" Two fingers—the least ruined—touched his cheek, almost ceremonial. \"Walk with ghosts if you must. Don't become one to keep them company.\"\n\nShe stepped away into the lane. The yard felt larger behind her—like a tent after the heat has gone.\n\n\n\nII. The Group Hears\n\n\n\nThe morning after a siege sounds like a town remembering how to breathe. Somewhere a hammer worked at timber. A child cried, then stopped. The smell of fresh bread moved through smoke-tinged air from a bakehouse that had stayed lit through everything, because bread doesn't care about thralls.\n\nThey were checking tack and repacking what hadn't burned in the stable yard when Caelin said, \"Nyx was summoned. She left word that she doesn't know when—or if—she'll be back.\"\n\nThe words landed in different ways on different people.\n\nVex set down a saddlebag with more care than usual—her ribs announcing themselves with every twist. \"Wonderful. Fewer purple fireworks and unsolicited philosophy.\" She pulled a strap tight and checked the buckle twice. A beat passed. Softer, grudging: \"Also fewer brain-scrambles when death squads show up, so... I suppose I'll miss the asset. A little.\" She slid a dagger home. \"Don't tell her I said that.\"\n\nThornik scratched his beard with a knuckle, eyes on the middle distance. \"Wouldn't dare. She'd charge us for sentiment.\"\n\nSerana only nodded, eyes already on the road that led east. She'd been looking at it since first light. \"We keep moving.\"\n\nDurgan said nothing. He stood at the yard's edge, blades already cleaned and sheathed, shadow flat and obedient at his feet in the morning sun. If the news moved him, it moved him in a place no one could see.\n\nThey worked in quiet for a while—the productive, necessary quiet of people packing for a journey they're not sure they're coming back from. Rolled blankets, counted coin, checked the edge on steel that had been used the night before and would be used again.\n\nAcross the yard, Aldric was inventorying his medical bag with the thorough patience of someone who'd learned the cost of discovering a shortage at the wrong moment. He didn't participate in the conversation. He listened the way old soldiers listen—head down, cataloguing, missing nothing.\n\n\n\nIII. Thornik's Choice\n\n\n\nThey found Thornik behind the smithy, where the local smith had let him use the corner of a workbench. He'd laid his tools out in a row—not randomly, but the way a soldier lays out equipment for inspection, each item in its place, each absence accounted for. The empty charge-loops from his harness. A cracked lens. The housing for a device that no longer had a mechanism to house. The things that had survived the mountain and the siege and could be carried forward. The things that couldn't.\n\n\"I'm leaving,\" he said, without looking up. The words came out heavier than he'd perhaps intended, landing on the stone floor of the smithy like something dropped. \"Not because I can't scrape up gear in Millbrook. I could. There's a metalworker on the east lane who does passable work, and I've made do with less.\"\n\nHe picked up the dragon-dwarf chisel—the one from his grandfather's maps, the one that had started all of this—and turned it in his hands. The etchings on the shaft were worn to suggestion, barely readable, the kind of thing you had to know was there to see.\n\n\"I'm leaving because I have to stand in front of my clan and say my grandfather wasn't mad. He was right.\" He set the chisel down and began wrapping it in oilcloth, slowly, with the care of someone performing a small ceremony. \"His journals, his maps, the chisel—if I don't put them in Deepstone hands myself, he stays a punchline and my name goes with him. That matters where I come from. It matters to me.\"\n\nCaelin watched him wrap the chisel. He thought about the mountain, about the vault that had opened for Thornik's key and no one else's. He thought about what it meant to have been right about something for thirty years with no one believing you.\n\n\"I'll retool at home,\" Thornik continued. \"Proper charges, lenses that don't crack when you look at them sideways, a housing that doesn't rattle. But that's not the reason. The reason is ancestry. And truth.\"\n\n\n\nHe turned to each of them in turn, and this part he'd clearly thought about.\n\nTo Vex, he held out a slim leather case, small enough to disappear into a palm. She opened it: three smoke-sticks, the kind that went off on impact and made it hard to see anything for thirty seconds. \"Disappearing, not winning,\" he said. \"Don't be clever with them. Just go.\"\n\n\"You've met me,\" Vex said.\n\n\"That's why I only gave you three.\"\n\nShe tucked them away.\n\nTo Caelin, an iron ring the width of a thumb, one quadrant filed to a gap. \"At dusk on Sixthday, tap three-one-two on any stone. If I'm above ground and within a week's march, it'll hum toward me.\" He pressed it into Caelin's palm. \"Don't lose it. I only made two and the other one's mine.\"\n\nTo Serana, last, a gear-coin stamped with the Deepstone mark—a small bronze disc the size of a knuckle. \"If I go quiet too long, show this at any Deepstone hall. They'll know how to find me.\" He held her gaze. \"I'm not planning to go quiet.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"I hate leaving you,\" he finished, and his voice went rough at the edges in the way of people who don't usually let it. \"But if I stay, I'm another body with the wrong tools. If I go, I come back with the right kit and proof that my grandfather's name means something. And he stops laughing alone.\"\n\nVex tucked the smoke-case into her jacket. \"Try not to die of politics.\"\n\n\"No promises,\" he said, and almost smiled. \"You know how clans are.\"\n\n\n\nIV. Serana's Road\n\n\n\nThey found her by the half-fallen chapel arch, alone. The chapel had taken smoke damage on the south wall; one window was gone, and the pale morning light came through the gap in a way that made the remaining stone look older than it was. She stood with her fingers resting on the arch, not in prayer—she'd have been the first to say so—but in the way of someone reading a language they used to be fluent in and were not sure they still spoke.\n\nShe heard them approach and didn't turn.\n\n\"I've been trying to find a way to say this that isn't a failure,\" she said. \"I haven't found one. So I'll just say it.\"\n\nShe turned then. Her face was composed—the particular composure of someone who'd made a decision and was standing behind it, not because it was easy but because it was the only honest thing left.\n\n\"My light failed,\" she said. \"You've seen it. It may return—I don't know—but right now I can't pray with any certainty that someone is listening. And I can't lead you while I don't know whose voice I'm following, if any. That would be dishonest. And dishonest faith is worse than no faith at all—it gets people killed on promises you can't keep.\"\n\nThe silence after that was the kind that asks not to be filled quickly.\n\nCaelin was the one who finally spoke. \"Where will you go?\"\n\n\"East. There's a place—an old house of retreat, not affiliated with any order—where they take people who are having difficulty with questions like mine.\" A pause. \"People who have lost the signal and are trying to find it again. Or learning to live without it.\" She looked at the gap in the chapel wall. \"I don't know which of those I'm doing yet.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"I don't know that either.\"\n\n\n\nShe unrolled a strip of plain linen inked with a knotwork sigil—old work, careful, the lines laid down with a steady hand. \"A vigil-knot. No goddess required—just breath and intention. Tie it round a wrist, speak the count of nine slowly, and it holds a line against panic for about an hour. Not much.\" She almost smiled. \"Enough, sometimes.\"\n\nShe pressed one into Caelin's hand, then set three more on the stone ledge of the arch. \"For whoever needs them. They'll keep.\"\n\n\"If I'm meant to come back, I will,\" she said. \"And if not—\" her eyes moved to each of them in turn, settling last on Caelin \"—you already know how to stand. You've been doing it since the mountain. You just didn't notice because I was nearby.\"\n\nVex had been quiet the whole time, which was unusual enough to notice. She unfolded her arms—carefully, because of the rib—and said: \"If your god is taking interviews, tell Her the customer service is abysmal.\"\n\nThe ghost of a smile crossed Serana's face—real, not performed. \"I'll pass it along.\"\n\nShe picked up her pack. It was lighter than it had been. She'd left the heavy things behind.\n\n\n\nV. The Mile-Stone\n\n\n\nThey met at the mile-stone where the road forked into three good choices and a dozen bad ones. The stone had names carved into it, most worn past reading—travellers who'd wanted to leave something behind at a crossing. Woodsmoke rode the evening air from the town, thinner now, dying down to its ordinary register.\n\n\"Three roads,\" Vex said. \"How poetic.\"\n\nNo one contradicted her.\n\nThornik had his pack on his back and his grandfather's chisel wrapped and stowed and his tool-harness sitting lighter than it had in months—not because it was empty but because what remained in it was what he'd chosen to keep. He looked north toward the mountains and then back at the group with the expression of a man who has made his decision and is waiting to see how it feels to live with it.\n\n\"Three roads,\" Serana answered, thumb working the edge of the gear-coin Thornik had given her. \"I don't know when mine turns back toward yours.\"\n\n\"With luck,\" Thornik said, and he tapped Caelin's tone-ring against the stone—three-one-two, a sound like a small careful knock—\"mine will rejoin before Depthspire. If not, the ring knows the way.\"\n\nCaelin pressed the ring between his fingers and felt the gap where the quadrant was missing. He thought about what it meant that Thornik had kept the matching one. He tightened the dark ribbon under his sleeve and said: \"We don't wait at doors we can't close. If we have to go in, we go in.\"\n\n\"And we find each other if we can,\" Serana said.\n\nThey stood at the stone for a moment longer than was strictly necessary. Nobody was in a rush to be the first to walk away. The light was going copper at the edges and the wind had come up from the northwest, carrying the smell of distance—cold grass, bare earth, the particular nothing-smell of a road that goes somewhere you haven't been.\n\nThey didn't hug. They weren't that kind of story yet. But they stood close enough that if any one of them had stumbled in that moment, the others would have caught them without thinking.\n\nThornik turned toward the northern road, the mountains catching the first cold stars. Serana took the eastward track, where old pilgrim stones lined the ditch like teeth worn to stubs. Caelin, Vex, and Durgan faced the merchant way.\n\nThe wind shifted. Iron-sweet from the ruined gate. Last hearth-smoke from a town that had held as long as it could. Somewhere far below stone, the Depthspire pulse came through the soles of their boots: Thud. Thud. Thud. Patient as geology. Counting.\n\nThey walked into their separate futures.\n\n\n\nAldric was waiting at the first bend in the road, medical bag over one shoulder, already facing north. He didn't say anything when they reached him. He fell into step at the back of the group, and that was that.",

The palisade gate stood propped with a beam Thornik had reset the night before—his last job in the town—and it creaked in the morning chill, wood resin sharp in the air.\n\nThe farewells were already done. They'd happened at a mile-stone a mile back, where the road forked three ways and people they trusted had taken two of the other turnings. What remained was just four shadows crossing frost-stiff grass, heading northeast.\n\nCaelin set an easy pace. The Ember's coal-glow tucked beneath a fresh wrap. The ribbon Nyxara had knotted at his wrist lay soft and cool against skin, its silver thread no darker than yesterday. He didn't tug at it. He resisted the urge to.\n\n\"Your stride's heavier,\" Vex said eventually, mismatched eyes flicking to his arm and away again. She was moving carefully herself—her ribs logged every twist of the torso, and she'd learned to stop twisting.\n\n\"Hurts more in the cold,\" Caelin admitted. \"It'll level out.\"\n\nDurgan walked rear guard, winter-pale and deliberate. He scanned the hedgerows and the ditch lines, not the road. When he stepped, his shadow stepped with him—with an effort most people wouldn't have noticed, but Vex did. She pretended not to.\n\nAldric walked between Durgan and the rest, which seemed to be where he'd decided he fit. He carried his medical bag slung across one shoulder and moved with the unhurried economy of a man who'd learned to conserve what he had a long time ago. He hadn't said anything since the mile-stone bend. He didn't appear to need to.\n\n\n\nBy the time the road bent past the last shepherd's croft, the smells had changed from dung smoke and malt to iron-rich streamwater and thawed loam. A farmer had nailed a square of parchment to a boundary post. Wind worried its corners.\n\nVex plucked it free, skimmed, snorted. \"You're famous.\"\n\nCaelin didn't need the illustration to know. The crude sketch got the angles of his face wrong but captured the impossible: a black mark in a man's forearm.\n\n\"Alive,\" Vex read. \"One thousand gold. More for the mark intact.\"\n\n\"Price is climbing,\" Durgan said, voice flat.\n\n\"Means we're interesting,\" Vex replied. \"Hate that.\"\n\nAldric leaned over and read the poster without taking it from Vex. \"The illustration's generous. You've got better cheekbones than that.\" He walked on. \"Also a thousand gold is insultingly low for whatever that thing in your arm actually is. Someone's being stingy.\"\n\nThey left the sign flapping on its nail. Crows watched from a hedge, heads cocked.\n\n\n\nTwo miles on, at a wayside shrine toppled by frost heave, Caelin dropped to a knee to tighten his boot. When he cinched the lace and reached for his pack, his fingers brushed paper that hadn't been there when they left town.\n\nHe froze. Then palmed it out.\n\nCream stock. No seal. Three words in an elegant hand that shifted colors in the light like oil on water:\n\nNorth by iron. Two days' grace. —L\n\nA prismatic dusting ran across the letters and vanished.\n\nVex caught the flick of paper. \"Problem?\"\n\n\"Map note,\" Caelin said, folding it into his sleeve. Not a lie. Not the truth.\n\nShe eyed him a beat longer than was comfortable, then nodded once. \"Good. We could use a map.\"\n\nThey rose and walked. The road narrowed to a wheel-track pressed between thorn and alder. Somewhere upslope, a hawk cried. The sky was pale, brittle, clean.",

Water ran high in the ditch—brown and cold, tea-bitter with tannin. The air smelled of wet wool, iron, and green things just remembering how to live.\n\nVex stopped so abruptly Caelin nearly walked into her. One gloved hand angled down: halt.\n\nShe'd seen it: a drag across the ditch slime where something heavy had been pulled, reeds crushed in a neat human pattern. On the hedge's far side, the faintest glint of brass where no brass should be.\n\n\"Trip-line,\" she breathed. \"Caltrops behind it.\"\n\nFrom the hedge ahead, a voice with too much bravado and not enough patience: \"Easy now. Hands up, no tricks.\"\n\nThree men broke the hedge at once—two with crossbows, one with a short fowling spear. They wore leather jacks with mismatched studs and the expressions of people who hadn't been paid yet.\n\n\"Don't,\" Vex said to Caelin without looking. \"You'll break yourself on farmers.\"\n\n\"Bounty's for alive,\" the spear carrier said, eyes on Caelin. \"We're not monsters.\"\n\nBehind Caelin, something thinned in the light. Vex didn't turn, but she felt it: Durgan's shadow flattening like a hound belly-crawling before a pounce.\n\n\"Crossbows down,\" Caelin said, keeping his voice level. \"And we'll talk.\"\n\nOne of the men smiled. It was not a good smile. \"Talking's extra.\"\n\nVex moved. Not the dramatic leap of a stage knife but a hunter's step—heel-to-ball, weight forward. A flick of wrist and the spearman's weapon wasn't in his hand anymore; it was in the ditch with a splash, and he was bleeding from the web of skin between thumb and forefinger in a way that made him as angry as it did clumsy.\n\nBoth crossbows thunked.\n\nCaelin didn't dodge.\n\nHeat spiked up the lattice in his arm—fast, focused, controlled. He punched his palm at the ground between them, not at the men. Air went hard in a fan and the ditchwater hissed—stone to glass in a strip three feet wide. The bolts hit the newborn slick and skated sideways into the hedge, thunk-thunk, harmless.\n\nThe pain arrived half a beat later. Not rupturing. Not yet. A white wire drawn through the filaments, singing in his teeth.\n\n\"Last chance,\" Caelin said, breath thin. \"Go home.\"\n\nThey didn't. The second crossbowman yelped something about \"hazard pay\" and crabbed sideways to get a shot. Durgan's blade touched his throat from behind before he finished the motion.\n\n\"Drop it,\" Durgan said. Calm. Too calm.\n\nThe man dropped it. The bowstring twanged and sang a sad little note as it hit the glass strip and spun.\n\nThe spear carrier dove for his weapon in the ditch, came up with cold mud and a broken glove. Vex met him halfway—rib to elbow, knee to thigh, heel to instep—a conversation he lost quickly and with regret.\n\nThe last one bolted.\n\nVex let him run. \"Tell your employer,\" she called, \"to upgrade the talent.\"\n\nShe retrieved the dropped spear and snapped it over her knee just because it felt good. The rib reminded her immediately that it had opinions about that. She absorbed the flash of pain without showing it, mostly.\n\nDurgan released the man he'd collared—gently, considering—and stepped back like he'd touched a stove. His nose was bleeding. He wiped it onto black cloth that wouldn't show it.\n\nCaelin exhaled, shakier than he wanted to be. The filaments along his forearm thrummed angrily then settled to their baseline ache—manageable. For now.\n\n\"What was that with the ground?\" Vex asked.\n\n\"Glass,\" Caelin said, flexing his hand. \"Easier to slide on than stand on.\"\n\n\"Going to assume you can only do that a handful of times before you chew your arm off.\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\nShe nodded, cataloguing his limits the way she catalogued everything. \"Noted.\"\n\n\n\nThey crossed the ditch at a dry spot Vex found upstream and cut through a copse of alder that smelled of cat-pee and river iron. The day leaned toward afternoon; clouds stacked to the west in slate wedges.\n\nThey found an abandoned charcoal clamp on the lee side of a low hill and took ten minutes to drink and breathe. Caelin's arm cooled to a sulk. Durgan watched his own shadow not move. Vex used a shard of Caelin's glass to trim a hanging thread from her sleeve with a surgeon's care.\n\nAldric set down his bag and looked at Vex. \"Rib.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\n\"You winced when you broke that spear. Sit down.\"\n\n\"I said—\"\n\n\"I know what you said.\" He was already opening the bag. \"Sit down.\"\n\nShe sat. He ran two fingers along the rib line with clinical detachment, found the break by her sharp intake of breath, and pronounced it the same as before—cracked, not displaced, nothing to do but strap it and stop doing stupid things with it. She didn't comment on the last part. He didn't expect her to.\n\nHe checked Caelin's arm wrap while he was at it—didn't touch the scale, just the bandaging. \"Holding,\" he said, in the tone of a man noting a weather gauge. Then he packed his bag and stood. \"Forest ahead?\"\n\n\"Ironwood fringe by nightfall,\" Vex said. \"If we keep moving.\"\n\n\"Stick to the hedge lines,\" Caelin said. \"Off the road the rest of the day.\"\n\nThey rose and moved on—quicker now, quieter. The hedgerows thinned to fern and dogrose. Crows followed at a polite distance.",

A forgotten road—older than any of them had a right to name—cut through in a shallow camber, the stones slick with moss and time.\n\nAt a crossroads of ruts and intention, a waystone stood hip-high—granite freckled with lichen, nine faint sigils carved around its crown. Most folks would see old scratches. Caelin's scale saw a circuit.\n\nThe Ember warmed. Not hot. Not warning. Recognition.\n\nVex crouched and brushed dirt from the base, revealing a dwarf-stamp so worn it was almost a rumor. \"Thornik would've loved this,\" she said, softer than she meant to.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Caelin said.\n\nHe dug into his pocket and found Serana's ward-disc—the little bronze coin stamped with a sunburst she'd pressed into his hand without a prayer. He set it on the waystone's flat top.\n\nFor a heartbeat, the disc's lines flared dull gold, as if something in the stone remembered what warding felt like. A faint smell of struck flint lifted and was gone.\n\n\"Still works,\" Vex said. \"A little.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Caelin said.\n\nThey ate cold trail-bread and harder cheese. Durgan drifted the perimeter like a boundary rider, never far, never comfortably close, the way a man walks when he doesn't trust the ground he's standing on.\n\nA moth the size of a thumb fluttered into the ward's slight radius and settled on the waystone. It fanned powdery wings, paused as if listening, then lifted into the dark. Somewhere far away, a fox barked twice.\n\nCaelin unrolled his bedroll beneath a blackthorn and only then checked his pack again. The cream note was gone. In its place, a strip of vellum narrower than a finger, rolled tight and tied with a thread that wasn't a color he could name.\n\nHe didn't open it.\n\nThe ribbon at his wrist lay quiet and cool. He resisted the itch to touch it.\n\n\n\nLater, when the forest had stilled to the sounds ironwoods make—sap whisper and the tiny crackle of frost forming—he woke to a light on the northern horizon that wasn't the moon.\n\nA curtain of green-white shimmered and folded on itself like silk lit from within, then tore and sealed without sound. The hairs on his forearms rose; the scale's lattice hummed to a pitch he could feel in his teeth.\n\n\"Wake,\" he said, already on one knee.\n\nVex sat up instantly, dagger half-drawn. Durgan turned his face north and didn't blink.\n\n\"What is that?\" Vex whispered.\n\n\"Depthspire,\" Caelin said, certain without knowing how. \"Something opened. Or closed.\"\n\n\"Doors,\" Durgan said. \"You can hear them even when you can't.\"\n\nFrom the far side of the waystone, Aldric sat up from his bedroll and looked north. He said nothing for a long moment. The aurora folded and refolded, silent and wrong.\n\n\"I've seen that light once before,\" he said finally. \"Two years ago, three weeks before Veln's Post.\" His voice was even—not steady the way a calm man is steady, but steady the way a man is steady who has decided what he thinks about something and is done renegotiating. \"It wasn't a warning. It was a door opening. And thirty-seven men died to whatever came through.\"\n\nNo one answered that. It didn't need an answer.\n\nThe light faded by degrees until the horizon was only horizon again, and the ironwoods went on pretending to be ordinary trees.\n\n\"Two days' grace,\" Caelin said under his breath, thinking of prismatic dust and steady hands. He didn't explain it.\n\nVex didn't ask.\n\n\"Forest track or Merchant Road?\" she asked instead.\n\n\"Forest,\" Caelin said. \"Humans on the road. Scouts hate ironwood.\"\n\n\"Scouts hate wards,\" Durgan added, nodding at the disc still warm with a memory of light.\n\n\"Then forest,\" Vex decided. \"We thread the old way.\"\n\n\n\nThey settled again to the kind of rest you take in pieces. Vex lay on her good shoulder and counted breaths until numbers didn't matter. Durgan watched his shadow not move and let the dark drink what it needed. Caelin held the unopened vellum and didn't open it.\n\nAldric sat with his back against the waystone, eyes open, doing the particular mathematics of a man who'd been told a door was opening and was calculating what might come through it. After a while he lay down, not because he thought he'd sleep, but because horizontal was better than the alternative.\n\nThe ironwoods creaked softly, like doors deciding when to be doors.\n\nAt some point, far to the north, something knocked once. Not loud. Not near.\n\nA patient sound.\n\nCounting.",

The air lost its tang of cold iron and sap; warm earth came up instead—mud, wet moss, the faint yeasty breath of leaf-rot. Caelin walked center, the witch-knot ribbon Nyxara had tied at his wrist dull as old wine in the daylight. Every so often it ticked with the gentlest tug, as if a spider had plucked a single strand of web and let it sing. Not a direction—just a proof of distance, of attention. Someone, somewhere, still watching.\n\nVex ranged left, favoring her wrapped ribs but moving like a rumor. Durgan took the right, ice-blue eyes on the tree line, shadow obedient as a good dog at noon. Aldric walked rear—medical bag across one shoulder, eyes moving between the road ahead and the tree line Durgan was watching, doing his own quiet accounting of threats.\n\nThe world smelled almost domestic for the first time since the mountain—woodsmoke drift from somewhere far downslope; a farm's latrine, honest and rank. Civilization as scent.\n\nThey hit the ruts of the old Merchant Road by noon—two pale crescents pressed into clay, puddles winking with sky. Ahead, a broken cart tilted against a ditch. A kettle still hung from its hook, long gone cold. Chicken feathers lay stuck to sap on a fallen branch. Someone had left in a hurry.\n\n\"Tracks,\" Vex said, crouching. \"Two families. One cartwheel cracked, they ditched it. Southbound—same as us.\" She sniffed the air, a feral, automatic habit. \"Yesterday, maybe sunrise.\"\n\nThe ribbon on Caelin's wrist gave that whisper-tug again. He didn't look at it. He touched the bronzed ward-disc Serana had pressed into his palm when she left—the surface etched with a line of secular intention, protective not because a god blessed it, but because a stubborn woman had. The metal held a little warmth. It steadied him more than he liked admitting.\n\n\"Company,\" Durgan murmured.\n\n\n\nThey saw the woman first—a farmer, hair gone wild, dress torn at the hem, one arm around a boy not more than seven and the other around a bundle that might have been bread or a baby. She stood in the road's center, frozen like a doe, staring at the black smear moving along the ditch shadow—a scout's shade, thin as spilled ink.\n\nThe thing reached for the boy's feet.\n\nDurgan moved.\n\nHe didn't think. He went. One clean sprint that ate the distance, one boot heel that slammed the shadow flat against bright clay, and then the soldier's rhythm took over—draw, slash, step; blade in a short arc that cut where light and ground met, the place shadows anchor. The shade recoiled, hissing without a mouth, and shivered itself thin to slither away.\n\nDurgan planted a second cut that pinned it like a nail through silk. \"Run,\" he told the woman without looking back. \"Don't stop until you see a palisade.\"\n\nShe didn't argue. The boy stared at Durgan's face like he'd never seen a man before; then he was swept down the road by his mother's panic.\n\n\"Check the boy for shock when you stop!\" Aldric called after them. \"He'll be quiet—that's the wrong kind of quiet!\" He watched them go, then looked at the smear on the road where the shade had been. \"That's different from what came through the vault.\" He said it without emphasis, matter-of-fact. \"The Veln's Post thing was bigger. Older. This is a forward scout.\"\n\nVex's eyes flicked to Durgan when it was done. Approval was not her currency, but it showed anyway, quick as light on a blade.\n\nCaelin exhaled a breath he hadn't known he held. The scale in his forearm said nothing—no sting, no warning. The world smelled of crushed grass and the metallic, coin-thin scent the shade had left behind.\n\nDurgan's nose was dry when he wiped it with the back of his hand. He checked anyway. Habit. Waiting.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Caelin said.\n\nDurgan sheathed his blade. \"Keep moving.\"\n\nThey did.",

                "text": "Act II: The Market Road Ambush\n\n\n\nThey smelled tar before they saw the barricade.\n\nThe road bent between two low knuckles of granite where ironwoods had failed to root; smoke lay in the turn like old breath. Four horses stood side by side, heads down, lather drying white on their necks. A rope-drag of dead brush spanned the road, glistening with black pitch. Six men in leather and scale waited behind it, crossbows already braced on the rocks. One wore a red kerchief at his throat; one had the lazy stance of someone who'd killed often enough to be bored by it.\n\n\"Afternoon,\" the bored one said. \"You match a description.\"\n\nVex's mouth twitched. \"Let me guess. 'Tall, cursed, and bad at avoiding trouble.'\"\n\n\"Something like that.\" The bored man's gaze never left Caelin's arm. \"Bounty says alive. Your friends may sulk off or not. Choice is a luxury but I'm magnanimous.\"\n\nAldric, standing at the back of the group, set his medical bag down on the road with the quiet deliberateness of a man who has been in enough of these situations to know that the bag stays where it can be reached quickly. He folded his hands and said nothing. He was not going to sulk off.\n\nCaelin's scale warmed. Not a flare; a gathering. He counted breaths, counted costs. The pitch-brush smelled like shipyards and siege ladders. Tar's flash point lived in his hands if he asked for it.\n\n\"Crossbow pivots,\" Vex murmured from the corner of her mouth. \"Two right, one left, leader center. Drop center, I delete right. You still standing?\"\n\n\"Standing,\" Caelin said. He flexed his hand. The lattice tugged back, a warning twine, but his body had learned new shapes for pain.\n\nDurgan's voice stayed flat. \"Last chance. Walk away.\"\n\nThe red-kerchief man smiled with his eyes. \"No.\"\n\nTime folded.\n\nVex moved first. A silver line crossed sunlight—her throwing knife—and the central bowman jerked as if a wasp stung his eye, then folded to the dust.\n\nCaelin breathed in. Heat gathered behind his ribs the way a forge gathers rightness; he pictured not fire but temperature, a widow's kiss that rushed through air without flame. His palm lifted. The pitch line sighed, then whoomph—tar flared in a low, fast curtain. Black smoke stamped the sky. The barricade twisted and fell.\n\nBolts sang toward them anyway—two, three. One hissed past Caelin's ear. One struck stone and cracked like a promise. One took Durgan's sleeve and left a slice of red without slowing him. He was already in their faces, blades walking the short economy of a soldier trained for close work. Two men went down with groans that would fade or not; he left them breathing on purpose.\n\nPain pealed through Caelin's arm—more bell than blade. He took it. Let it ring his bones. He dropped to one knee and pulled air through his teeth, felt the lattice complain, then settle into the old, ugly baseline.\n\nVex hit the right-hand pair like consequence. First man's wrist—snapped; second's kneecap—cut; she drove her pommel into a temple and let him sleep out his poor choices. The last bounty hunter—the bored one—dropped his crossbow, raised his hands, and smiled again with nothing to smile about.\n\n\"Mercy?\" he said.\n\nDurgan's knife was at his throat. \"You'll leave a message.\"\n\n\"Ah. To whom?\"\n\n\"Whoever pays you. Tell them you saw the fire and lived. Tell them next time you won't.\"\n\nThe man swallowed, his Adam's apple pushing the blade. \"I can do polite.\"\n\n\"Do it farther away.\" Durgan stepped back. The shadow under his boots stayed ordinary in the full hammer of noon.\n\n\n\nThey dragged the pitch brush off the road with their boots. The world was tar reek and burned horsehair and the sour tang of someone's fear-sweat.\n\nAldric went straight to Durgan. \"Sleeve up.\"\n\n\"It's a scratch.\"\n\n\"Sleeve up.\"\n\nDurgan pushed up the sleeve. The bolt had opened a four-inch line across the forearm—clean, not deep. Aldric cleaned it with something from a small flask that smelled medicinal and unpleasant, bound it with three quick turns of linen, and tied it off without ceremony. \"Keep it dry. It won't.\" He looked at Caelin on one knee. \"How's the arm?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.\"\n\n\"It's the answer I have.\"\n\nAldric looked at him for a moment with the expression of a man who'd heard that particular response in that particular tone before, from men who were about to find out it wasn't enough. He let it go. For now.\n\nVex wiped her knife on a patch of clean grass and cocked a brow at Caelin. \"How many of those,\" she said, nodding at the blackened barricade, \"before you fall down and I have to carry you?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" Caelin admitted. \"Fewer than we'd like. More than yesterday.\"\n\n\"Progress,\" she said, and almost smiled.\n\nDurgan wiped his sleeve. No blood on his hand this time. He exhaled once, like a man setting a weight down where no one would notice.\n\nThey took the horses nobody wanted to keep and rode until the light went copper.",

                "text": "Act III: The Boundary Bridge\n\n\n\nEvening found them on the lip of an old wound—an earthquake's mouth split months ago or centuries, who could say. A basalt bridge arched the gap in a single impossible span, black as a raven's back, edges beveled to a craftsman's vanity. Wind lived down there. It smelled of cold stone and something old and salty, though the sea lay weeks away.\n\nAt the near end of the bridge, someone had carved a sigil into a waist-high stone: a circle doubled back on itself, nine spokes, the tenth line severed. Thornik would have told them the lineage of the chisel marks. In his absence, Caelin only felt seen. The scale warmed, shyly. Vex touched the symbol with two fingers and let the gesture be a greeting.\n\nHalfway across, the light changed.\n\nNot dimmer—stranger. The sun still bled out across the world, but the space over the span held a second dusk of its own, a hush laid over air. Caelin tasted metal on his tongue. The ribbon at his wrist gave a single bright pluck, like a harpstring in a room with no hands.\n\nWords raised from the stone, not carved but standing—letters the eye only loved if it looked from the side.\n\nSpeak true or speak not at all.\n\nVex stopped dead. \"I hate bridges that talk.\"\n\n\"It's a ward,\" Caelin said. He took out Serana's disc. The secular line etched into bronze caught the odd light and answered in a soft, stubborn glow. The sense of it wasn't holy, not anymore. It was made strong by work. By intention. I will keep what I can.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"We are crossing to the plateau. We intend to harm no one who does not try to harm us. We seek a prison that isn't a prison.\" He paused. Laughed once at himself. \"We're in over our heads.\"\n\nThe bridge listened. Said nothing. But the pressure eased enough to breathe.\n\n\"Fine,\" Vex said, and stepped into the ward's hush. She could have lied to it with panache. She chose not to. \"I am very tired,\" she informed the air. \"I am very hungry. I do not want to die before I stab whoever designed this road.\"\n\nThe hush let her pass.\n\nDurgan hesitated a fraction. His shadow bled one inch toward the parapet, stopped as if it had hit glass, and recoiled like a burned animal. The smell of singed wool flicked the air then died, leaving the clean ache of wind.\n\n\"I will not hurt them,\" he said to no one and everyone. \"Not while I am me.\"\n\nThe ward accepted that as truth.\n\nAldric stepped up to the ward's edge and stood there a moment with his hands at his sides. He didn't look like a man performing sincerity. He looked like a man who'd decided what was true and was simply reporting it.\n\n\"I came to find out what killed thirty-seven men,\" he said. \"And if there's anything left to do about it.\"\n\nThe hush considered this and let him through.\n\n\n\nThey stood at the bridge's crown and looked north. The world beyond rolled away in bruised gold: scrub, broken stone, low thorn. And there, like a nail driven into the horizon, lay a black plateau shouldering out of the world—the Depthspire rise, not yet the thing itself, but the country of it. Above, a pale aurora wrote thin curtains across the sky where no such lights should run.\n\nA square of folded paper fell out of Caelin's pack and landed against his boot.\n\nVex's hand hit a dagger before he'd bent to pick it up. Durgan's blades whispered half-free and went still when nothing moved to justify it.\n\nThe note was ordinary to the point of insolence—cheap stock, black ink, a smell of old lavender as if it had slept too long in an honest drawer.\n\nCaelin opened it.\n\nYour pace is sufficient. Keep the road's left edge when the basalt goes to clay; the right is mined by men who will not remember why they laid the charges. I will not wait long at the first watch-tower. —L\n\nVex made a face that belonged to someone who'd bitten a green apple. \"Divination and manners,\" she said. \"Pick one.\"\n\nCaelin folded the note, slid it away. \"He's ahead of us.\"\n\n\"Or behind and being clever about it.\" Vex shaded her eyes against a wind that didn't need shading. \"Either way, I vote we don't sleep on the bridge.\"\n\nAldric looked at the note Caelin had pocketed, then at the plateau on the horizon, then said nothing. He'd stopped asking who L was. The answer was somewhere north of them and he'd find out when they got there.\n\n\n\nThey finished the span, and the hush let them go. On the far side, someone had piled three stones into a cairn you'd miss if you blinked. Caelin set Serana's disc on the top for a breath, warmed it with the heat the scale made when it was patient, and took it back. The night smelled of sage crushed under boots and basalt cooling after day.\n\nThey made camp in the lee of a boulder where the wind could sing without tearing the blankets loose. The ribbon at Caelin's wrist lay quiet. The ward-disc held its stubborn warmth. Durgan set himself where he could see both the bridge and their fire; when his nose bled, he turned his head and let the dark drink it. Aldric sat with his back to the boulder and his bag between his feet and looked north, doing whatever arithmetic he'd been doing since Veln's Post and not sharing the result.\n\nSleep came as a courtesy, not a gift.",

                "text": "Epilogue\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe slab fell.\n\nWhat came after was dark and cold and the kind of silence that exists deep inside stone—not empty, but occupied, the way old places are occupied by the weight of their own age. The grinding had stopped. Dust still moved in the air. It would move for a long time.\n\nThe root-web was gone. Every thread of it—spent, not broken, burned from green to white to nothing in the last three seconds before impact. The tattoos along her arms were pale, almost colorless in the dark. The magic that had given her new language for the past weeks had emptied itself out completely. She could feel the absence where it had been. Like a room she'd lived in that now held only the outline of furniture.\n\nShe was alive.\n\nThat was—that was unexpected.\n\nShe took a slow inventory, the way her circle had taught her: start at the feet, move up, report honestly. Left ankle — wrong, grinding, don't move it. Ribs — several. A warmth at her temple that would be blood. The staff was gone; she could feel that the way you feel a lost tooth — not just absence but the shape of absence. Everything hurt, which was fine. Everything hurting meant nerves reporting from a body that was still present.\n\nThe dark was absolute. She had no light, no fire, no silver-borrowed glow. The vine-ink along her arms gave nothing.\n\nBut something else did.\n\nIt was faint — thin as a thread pulled through the eye of a needle from a great distance. Not her magic. Not anything she'd called or shaped. It came from below her, from the roots of the mountain itself, from systems so old they predated the Concord's seals by centuries. Mountain oak. Ancient alder. The deep network that connected living things through stone and loam and the slow patience of trees.\n\nIt had caught her.\n\nNot gently. Not carefully. The way a root catches a thing rolling toward a cliff edge — at the last possible moment, with no concern for comfort. She was wedged against a natural shelf of stone she hadn't landed on so much as been deposited on, bruised and broken in the way of things that fall a long way and survive it. The root structure around her was faintly warm. Not warm like fire. Warm like something alive.\n\nShe didn't know if it knew she was there. She didn't know if it had chosen her or simply intercepted her the way a river intercepts rain.\n\nShe lay still and breathed and let the thin warmth of it be the only thing that mattered.\n\nAbove her, far above, Caelin had said her name to a sealed scar of stone that did not care.\n\nBelow her, the mountain went on doing whatever mountains do in the dark, in the deep, in the patient counting silence, long after the people on its surface had stopped paying attention.\n\nShe was alive.\n\nFor now, that was enough.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe wards had been failing for two years.\n\nNot dramatically—not in the way of things collapsing or breaking or announcing themselves with noise. Slowly, the way ice fails in the first days of a warm season: a hairline at the margin, then another, then a slow creep toward center that goes unnoticed until the whole surface is laced with fractures and one footstep is all it takes.\n\nThe prisoners on the upper levels had felt it first. They always would—they were closest to the surface, closest to the light they'd been sealed away from. The shadow-things that had come to Millbrook were only the outermost layer of what Depthspire held: scouts, explorers, the opportunistic edge of a population that had been confined for a generation and was learning, by degrees, that the walls were not what they used to be.\n\nDeeper, the older things waited with older patience.\n\nThe Concord had built Depthspire as a system. Each level harder than the last. Each prisoner more dangerous than the one above, positioned as both inmate and deterrent—the logic being that anything trying to reach the vault at the bottom would have to pass through layer after layer of something that very much did not want to be passed through. It had worked, for a while. It had worked for eighty years.\n\nBut the Nine relics were waking. Not all at once, not at the same rate, but in the way of interconnected things when one begins to resonate—the others follow. The binding magic threaded through Depthspire's architecture was tuned to a stillness that no longer existed. Every relic that came alive was another string plucked in a net designed for silence. And the creatures in the deep levels could feel each one.\n\nOn the third level, something with too many joints pressed itself against a ward-wall that had developed a soft spot the size of a palm. It pressed, and the wall gave a little, and it pressed again. It had been pressing for six weeks. It was not in a hurry.\n\nOn the fifth level, in a chamber the original architects had flooded as a secondary measure, something moved through the water in slow circles. The flood had been receding for eighteen months as the drainage seals cracked. There was less water than there had been. There would be less still. The thing in the water was adjusting to this with the pragmatism of something that had survived worse than a room running dry.\n\nAt the base—the real base, the level the Concord had built everything else above in order to contain it—there was no prisoner.\n\nThe Concord had not built Depthspire around a prisoner.\n\nThey had built it around something older than the Concord, older than the kingdom that had preceded it, older than the language the wards were written in. Something they had found already in the deep rock, already contained by methods they did not fully understand, already patient in its darkness in a way that suggested it had been patient for a very long time and had learned not to waste effort on urgency.\n\nThey had added their own seals to whatever had come before. Layers on layers. Very thorough. Very carefully done.\n\nThe seals were failing.\n\nNot the old ones—not yet. The old ones were different in kind from anything the Concord's engineers had built, and they were holding in the way of things built by people who understood what they were holding. But the Concord's layers, the careful human additions, the wards tuned to a silence that no longer existed—those were fracturing.\n\nBelow everything, in the dark that predated the structure above it, something that had been very still for a very long time made a sound.\n\nNot a word. Not a movement. Just a sound.\n\nPatient as geology.\n\nCounting.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThey walked north.\n\nThe plateau had been visible since morning—a black shelf of rock pushing up out of the horizon like something that had always been there and had simply been waiting for the angle to be right. The Depthspire rise. Not the structure itself, not yet, but the approach to it, the country of it, the air that had been breathing the same cold breath as whatever was sealed in the deep below.\n\nThe scale in Caelin's arm had been warm since they crossed the Boundary Bridge. Not warning-warm, not the red-orange of effort or pain. Just warm. Present. The way a compass needle is present when you stop arguing with it and let it point.\n\nAldric walked at the back and said nothing. He'd been doing the arithmetic for months. He was nearly at an answer.\n\nDurgan walked the right flank with his shadow flat and obedient at his boots and his eyes on the tree line and his jaw set in the way of a man who has decided to keep making the choice one day at a time and not ask himself how many days he has left.\n\nVex walked left, ribs strapped, shoulder working, her eyes already on the plateau with the professional attention of someone calculating entrances and sight lines and the distance between where they were and where the trouble would start.\n\nNo one spoke. The road was basalt now, the clay having given way an hour back exactly where L's note had said it would.\n\nThe scale pulled north.\n\nThe plateau waited.\n\nSomewhere below it, in the dark where the wards were fracturing and the old things were stirring and something older than all of it had made a sound — the counting continued.\n\nBook Two begins at the gate.",

He’d been heading nowhere in particular, the way a man does when the war is over and the shape of peacetime hasn’t settled yet. A hedge-knight’s work: a missing horse here, a disputed boundary there. Small things. Useful things. Things that didn’t ask him to be more than he was.\n\nThen the smoke.\n\nThornwick still smoked when Caelin rode in at first light.\n\nAsh muffled the cobbles, the horse’s hooves swallowed by the soft texture and depth of the soot-packed street. Melted stone and hot glass mingling with the acrid bite of charred timber. Houses hadn't burned so much as slumped: wooden beams turned translucent, doorframes sagging into glossy curves, window mullions weeping clear droplets that froze mid-fall. Even the lane stones had softened and set again, their surfaces ridged like cooled lava.\n\nHe'd seen dragonfire before—in the war, villages reduced to char and ash in minutes. But this was different. This fire hadn't consumed. It had transformed.\n\nA cry—thin, desperate, trapped—cut through the silence.\n\nHe ran.\n\nAt the end of the south lane, a cottage had folded in on itself like a paper lantern crushed by an invisible fist. \"Hold on!\" Caelin called, dropping to his knees in the debris. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here,\" a small voice gasped, barely audible through the rubble. \"It's hot—please—\"\n\nHe found her beneath a collapsed roof beam: maybe eight years old, freckled face streaked with soot, pinned by timber that still shimmered with residual heat. Her eyes were wide with terror, tracking the glow in the wood above her.\n\n\"You're going to be all right,\" he said, setting his palm against the scorching beam.\n\nHe called the flame the way he always had—shaping heat to eat along the grain, to reduce wood to ash and set her free. But the magic answered differently this time. The beam didn't char or crumble. It softened. Fibers gave way beneath his touch, going glassy and viscous, sloughing under his hand in a slow, honey-thick peel. He drew the beam aside in a translucent sheet; the instant it left contact with his skin, it hardened with a sharp crack and shattered.\n\nThe girl stared up at him with wonder and fear in equal measure.\n\nHe stared at his own hand.\n\n\"Fire shouldn't do this,\" he murmured, more to himself than to her.\n\nHe gathered the child up in his arms, feeling how she trembled against him. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Mira.\"\n\n\"I'm Caelin. Close your eyes now. The air's bad out here.\"\n\nOutside, where the square's wind provided some relief from the smoke, she curled into his travel cloak like it was the only safe thing left in the world. Her lips trembled as she tried to form words.\n\n\"Mama said to hide,\" she whispered finally. \"But the red lady saw me anyway. She spoke to me.\"\n\n\"The dragon?\" Caelin asked, though something in his chest already knew the answer.\n\nMira nodded, her small fingers clutching his cloak tighter. \"She said she was looking for the ember-born. She said she was sorry but she had to know.\" The child's voice dropped to barely audible. \"Then she sang something. A rhyme. Over and over while the fire came. I... I remember it.\"\n\nBefore he could respond, Elder Gareth emerged from the smoke—one cheek blistered raw, his beard singed away on that side, but his eyes still steady with the kind of strength that comes from bearing witness to catastrophe.\n\n\"You saved one,\" the old man rasped, his voice thick with smoke and grief. \"The gods bless you for it.\"\n\n\"She wasn't hunting,\" Mira whispered against Caelin's shoulder. \"She kept saying she was sorry. That she had to find someone.\"\n\nGareth nodded grimly. \"Dragons kill clean when they feed—quick, then gone. This was deliberate. Methodical. She melted the shrine down to its foundation stones but left the granary untouched. Destroyed the inn but spared the healer's cottage.\" His eyes met Caelin's. \"She was testing. Calling out in the old tongue, waiting for something to answer.\"\n\nSomething prickled along Caelin's forearms, a readiness sharpening his awareness. He'd spent years studying fragments of Draconic in dusty libraries, and his dreams had carried sounds and syllables that weren't his own. Now the anticipation felt physical, like standing on the edge of a precipice, waiting for the moment gravity takes hold.\n\nMira tugged at his sleeve with surprising insistence. \"The rhyme. Do you want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Please,\" Caelin said, though the answer was already pressing against his ribs like a held breath.\n\nThe child swallowed hard and recited in a thin, earnest voice:\n\nNine the arts and nine the lights, Nine the souls to set them right; Keep the chain and guard the frame— Wake not the Tenth that has no name.\n\nThe words settled into him like keys finding locks, fitting into spaces he hadn't known were waiting to be filled.\n\nGareth pointed beyond the mill with a hand that trembled slightly. \"Her trail ends past the hedgerow. The ground there is...\" He struggled for words. \"The earth has turned to glass. Black glass, like obsidian. There's a crater, and at the center...\" He shook his head. \"You should see it yourself.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" Caelin said, because any other response felt like turning away from something that had been calling him for years.\n\nHe didn’t look back at Mira. He was afraid if he did he would stay, and staying felt like the wrong kind of cowardice.",

The destruction formed a clear line—deliberate, purposeful—leading away from the village center toward the fields beyond. \n\nMira’s rhyme clung to him like smoke. Each word seemed to settle behind his ribs, waiting for something that hadn’t yet awoken.\n\nWhere the hedgerow ended, the earth had transformed entirely.\n\nA shallow crater yawned before him, perhaps fifty feet across. Its floor and walls were black glass—pure obsidian that caught the morning light and threw it back in dark rainbows. Crystalline spires jutted up from the rim like the fingers of a buried giant reaching for sky. Steam rose in lazy spirals, carrying the sharp mineral scent of transformed stone.\n\nAt the center lay the dragon.\n\nShe was vast beyond mortal scale, easily the size of Gareth's barn. Her hide had dulled from coal-red to ash-crimson, fissured along her flanks where internal heat still glowed like forge embers struggling against the dark. Each breath came as a failing rasp, wet and rattling. Her wings lay crumpled and torn, one bent at an angle that made Caelin wince. But her eyes—old gold, ancient as mountains—still held purpose.\n\nCaelin slid down the crater's inner slope. The glass sang beneath his boots, a low crystalline hum that resonated in his chest.\n\nThe dragon's eye tracked his descent and fixed on him.\n\nHer voice arrived not as sound but as meaning pressing directly into his mind—old Draconic rendered crystalline and clear, as if a fog he hadn't known was there had suddenly lifted.\n\n\"At last,\" she said, and relief colored the words. \"The bloodline answers.\"\n\nHe went to one knee, instinct deeper than thought. \"Why did you do this? All those people—\"\n\n\"I had no choice.\" came the answer, heavy with genuine regret.  \"I am dying. I felt it three days ago—the rot in my heart, the fire going cold. And I carry something that cannot die with me. Something that must pass to one who can bear it.\" Her eye closed briefly. \"I searched the nearby villages. Called out in the old tongue. Used fire to test who might answer, who might have the gift to work flame differently than others.\"\n\n\"You killed them to test them?\" Horror and anger warred in his chest.\n\n\"I tested the fire,\" she corrected, and there was no defensiveness in it—only weary fact. \"Most would have burned. Only one with dragon-blood could have shaped what I wrought. Only the ember-born could have turned transformation back to wood, glass back to timber.\" Her eye opened and fixed on him again. \"You saved the child. You proved what you are.\"\n\nThe truth of it settled cold in his stomach. She'd been searching for him. And people had died in that search.\n\n\"What are you?\" he asked, voice rough.\n\n\"Vharisax, last guardian of the First Concord. And my time ends.\" She shifted slightly, and the movement cost her. \"But the compact must continue. The Nine must be found. The Seal must remain closed.\"\n\n\"The rhyme,\" Caelin said. \"The child remembered it. Nine the arts—\"\n\n\"Nine that weave the world,\" Vharisax said. Images flooded his mind—dragons and dwarves forging side by side, a name carved above a gate in a script older than any living tongue, nine pedestals blazing with power, and beneath them something vast and chained, pressing against its bonds. The weight of it left Caelin gasping.\n\nCaelin’s breath had gone shallow. He didn’t know when that had happened.\n\n\"The Nine maintain balance,\" Vharisax continued. \"Each school of magic bound into physical form, each requiring a bearer to claim it, to become it. When all nine are claimed and the bearers stand together, the Seal remains closed. But if the Nine are scattered, lost, or broken...\" Her breathing hitched. \"The Tenth stirs. And if it wakes fully, the world drowns in entropy made conscious.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" The question came out smaller than he intended.\n\n\"You carry the old blood. Faint, yes—diluted through generations—but present. You can bond with what I give you. You can survive it.\" Her foreclaw trembled as she lifted it. \"And you have no choice. I am dying now. If I do not pass this on, it dies with me. The compact breaks. The chain weakens.\"\n\nNestled against talon and scale lay a plate of obsidian-red, roughly the length of his thumb, hexagonal edges still carrying forge-heat. It pulsed with inner light—ember-motes drifting in its translucent depths.\n\nNot a shed scale. An offering.\n\n\"This is the key,\" Vharisax said. \"Take it. Bind yourself. Follow the path I will leave you. Find the First Sanctum and claim what waits there—the Dragon's Ember, first of the Nine, forged for Evocation itself.\" Her eye held his. \"And then find the others who must bear the rest. You cannot do this alone.\"\n\nHis hand hovered above the scale, every instinct screaming that this was a threshold he couldn't uncross. \"What will it do to me?\"\n\n\"It will mark you. Visibly. Permanently.\" No false comfort. \"It will guide you toward what must be found. It will punish deception and reward truth. It will hurt, especially at first.\" Her tone softened slightly. \"And it will make you exactly what you already are—only more so. The magic you've always carried will awaken fully. You will understand the old tongue. You will see the paths others cannot.\"\n\n\"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Then I die carrying this burden. The compact weakens. The Seal cracks a little more. And in a generation, perhaps two, something that should never breathe air will taste sky.\" She held his gaze. \"I do not offer you glory, ember-born. I offer you necessity.\"\n\nThe weight of her certainty pressed against him. The crater, the transformed village, the child's terrified eyes—all of it leading to this moment.\n\nCaelin closed his fingers around the scale.\n\nHeat surged up his arm—hot glass seeking its shape, reality rewriting itself cell by cell. For a moment the world went white, then cleared, he looked down at his right forearm.\n\nA thumb-length, hexagonal plate lay flush with his skin just below the elbow—dark as translucent obsidian, smooth as glass, with ember-motes drifting lazily in its depths like captured stars. The edges were perfect, geometric, inlaid so seamlessly with his flesh that he couldn't tell where the scale ended and his skin began.\n\nFrom its six edges, hair-fine black filaments spread like delicate root systems, threading beneath his skin in branching patterns. They ran toward his elbow, toward his wrist, mapping themselves along nerve pathways with dark precision. He could feel them settling, finding their places, becoming part of his body's geography.\n\nHe flexed his fingers. The embedded plate flexed with him, the filaments shifting beneath his skin like living tattoo.\n\n\"There,\" Vharisax said, and satisfaction colored her fading voice. \"The bond is struck. You are marked. You are chosen.\"\n\n\"It will answer you,\" she continued, each word coming slower. \"And it will correct you. When you speak falsehood, it will sting. When you hesitate before necessity, it will push. When you attempt to flee your purpose...\" A thread of dark humor. \"It will drag you back to the path.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he said.\n\nThe embedded plate snapped white-hot—a needle of searing light that lanced through every nerve in his arm. He gasped, biting back a cry, and the glow subsided to steady ember.\n\n\"Truth,\" Vharisax said, approval warming the word. \"Already you learn. Never lie to the scale, ember-born. It knows you better than you know yourself.\"\n\nHe cradled his arm, feeling the residual heat pulse beneath his skin. \"What do I do now?\"\n\n\"Follow the flame-path I will leave. It leads to the Emberpeaks, to the First Sanctum. There you will find the Dragon's Ember—the first of the Nine Relics, the anchor of Evocation itself. Claim it. Bond with it fully.\" Her breathing grew more labored. \"Then seek the others. The bearers are out there, scattered, most unaware of what they're meant to become. You must find them. Gather them. Before the Seal breaks entirely.\"\n\n\"And the Tenth?\" he asked. \"What's truly buried there?\"\n\n\"Old,\" she whispered. \"A bargain made in the world's first age. Power that should never have been. The Nine were forged to keep it sleeping.\" Her voice dropped to bare thread. \"If you hear it calling—and you will, if you draw too close—do not answer. Do not try to wake it. Not yet. Perhaps not ever.\"\n\nHer chest rose once more, held, and fell for the final time. The glow along her fissured flanks dimmed—and then, instead of darkness, it brightened.\n\nNot the orange of living fire. Something older. Deeper. The light moved through her scales the way flame moves through paper held to a candle—catching at the edges first, the great plates along her spine curling inward as they ignited, translucent and amber before dissolving to nothing. The transformation swept forward from her tail to her throat in a slow, inevitable tide. Scale by scale, ridge by ridge, the body that had carried a thousand years of memory began to come apart—not violently, not with heat or sound, but with the quiet authority of something that had decided it was finished.\n\nCaelin couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away.\n\nVharisax burned like a letter burning—edges first, then the body of the thing, each piece glowing brilliant before it released. Her wings went last, the great membranes thinning to lace, to light, to nothing. Where she had lain, the crater floor held only the ghost of her outline in glass.\n\nAnd then the embers came for him.\n\nThey rose in a slow column—ten thousand motes of ash and amber light, drifting upward as if gravity had briefly lost interest in them. They turned in the air above the crater, unhurried, and Caelin understood with bone-deep certainty that they were not random. They were choosing.\n\nThe column tilted. Descended.\n\nThey settled on the scale.\n\nOne by one, and then in streams, and then all at once—every mote of what had been Vharisax finding its way to the obsidian plate in his forearm, sinking into the translucent surface and becoming part of the ember-motes already drifting there. The scale flared so bright he had to turn his face away. Heat moved through the filaments like a second bonding—not painful this time, but immense. The weight of it. The age of it. A thousand years of flight and memory and purpose flowing into six inches of hexagonal obsidian set in a man’s arm.\n\nWhen the last ember settled, the crater was empty.\n\nThe scale dimmed to its steady coal-glow. The filaments cooled. Caelin stood in the glass-smooth hollow where a dragon had died, and breathed, and tried to understand what he was carrying now.\n\nFrom the crater’s rim, the flame-path stretched away toward distant mountains—fine as a thread of silk, bright as a road paved with light. It hadn’t been there a moment ago. Or perhaps it had always been there, and something in him had finally learned to see it.\n\nFootsteps crunched on glass behind him.",

                "text": "Act III: Unlikely Alliance\n\n\"Well,\" a voice observed, dry as desert wind. \"That looks profoundly uncomfortable.\"\n\nCaelin spun, hand instinctively moving to the sword at his hip.\n\nA woman leaned against the glass ridge, arms crossed, assessing him with the calm focus of a predator deciding if he was a threat or opportunity. Twin daggers rested at her hips, their hilts worn smooth with use. Her travel cloak was torn and stained with ash, and one eye was green while the other shone gold, catching the light like a cat's.\n\nHer expression suggested she found the entire situation darkly amusing.\n\n\"Virella Sunshadow,\" she said, not moving from her perch. \"Though people who haven't tried to murder me yet generally call me Vex.\"\n\n\"How long have you been there?\" Caelin asked, still catching his breath from the bonding.\n\n\"Long enough.\" She pushed off from the stone and slid down the glass slope with practiced ease, boots finding purchase where he would have slipped. \"Long enough to watch a dragon die passing something to a stranger. Long enough to see that very permanent addition to your arm.\" Her mismatched gaze dropped to the embedded scale, studying it with professional interest. \"Interesting accessory. Not exactly subtle.\"\n\nCaelin instinctively tried to cover it with his other hand, then stopped. What was the point? The scale was flush with his skin, inlaid like jewelry he could never remove. \"You shouldn't be here. This is—\"\n\n\"Dangerous? Obviously.\" Vex stopped a few feet away, close enough to talk comfortably, far enough to react if he proved hostile. \"But I've been tracking something dangerous for months now, so the ambiance feels appropriate.\"\n\n\"Tracking what?\"\n\n\"Answers.\" She pulled a water-stained journal from inside her cloak and held it up briefly before tucking it away again. \"My mother was a scholar. Obsessed with old alliances, ancient pacts, something she called 'fire-kept covenants.' She died six months ago in the Emberpeaks, and all I have left are her research notes and more questions than sense.\"\n\nVex gestured at the dragon's crystalline corpse. \"Her last journal entry mentioned rumors of a dragon searching for something. That was three weeks before she disappeared. So when I heard about a dragon burning villages in a very specific pattern—not raiding, not feeding, but searching—I followed the trail.\" Her eyes met his. \"And here I find not treasure, but you. With that.\" A nod at his arm.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm against his skin, but didn't sting. Whatever else Vex might be hiding, she was being honest about her motivations.\n\n\"Your mother was looking for the same thing the dragon gave me,\" Caelin said slowly.\n\n\"Was she?\" Vex's tone sharpened with interest. \"And what exactly did that dying dragon give you, besides permanent body modification?\"\n\nHe hesitated. The scale warmed in warning—truth or pain, choose. \"A burden. A purpose. A path to follow.\"\n\n\"How poetically vague.\" But her eyes tracked to something behind him, and her expression shifted. \"What are you staring at?\"\n\nCaelin glanced back at the flame-thread stretching toward the mountains, then returned his attention to her. \"You can't see it?\"\n\n\"See what?\" Vex followed his gaze, squinting at empty air above the crater's rim. \"All I'm getting is heat shimmer and the worst headache I've had in months. Which, given my lifestyle, is saying something.\"\n\n\"There's a path. Fire, but not fire. Leading into the Emberpeaks.\" He flexed his marked arm, feeling the scale pulse in time with the distant thread. \"The dragon said only those marked could see it.\"\n\n\"Of course she did.\" Vex rubbed her temples. \"Let me guess—this invisible magic road leads straight into the mountains where my mother vanished. Where the last three caravans disappeared without a trace. Where absolutely nothing good has been heard from in half a year.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"Perfect.\" She let her hands drop and fixed him with an evaluating look. \"New arrangement, then. You need someone watching your back while you follow your glowing destiny path. I need someone who can actually see where we're going and potentially lead me to what my mother died seeking.\"\n\n\"We?\" Caelin raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You walk in front,\" Vex said with the practicality of someone who'd survived on the margins, \"drawing every monster's attention with that beacon in your arm. I follow behind, keeping us both alive with my actually useful skills like not getting eaten. Meanwhile, we both get closer to our answers.\"\n\n\"That's your pitch? I'm bait?\"\n\n\"Mutually beneficial bait.\" Her mouth quirked. \"Look, you're going into those mountains whether I come or not—I can see it in your face. That scale's already made the choice for you. And I'm going regardless of whether you want company, because my mother's last camp was somewhere in those peaks and I'm not leaving until I know what happened to her.\"\n\nShe crossed her arms. \"So we can stumble into whatever's waiting separately and probably both die, or we can watch each other's backs and maybe one of us survives long enough to accomplish something. Your choice, ember-boy.\"\n\nThe nickname irritated him, but the logic was sound. And the scale wasn't stinging—she meant what she said.\n\n\"You said your mother called them 'fire-kept covenants,'\" Caelin said. \"Did her notes mention anything about Nine? Or about something sealed?\"\n\nVex's expression sharpened. \"The Ninefold Concord. She had that phrase written everywhere in her later journals—underlined, circled, with question marks. She thought it was some kind of alliance between dragons and... someone else. Dwarves, maybe. From before the kingdoms.\" Her mismatched eyes narrowed. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the dragon spoke of Nine relics. Nine bearers. And something called the Tenth that has to stay sleeping.\" The words felt too big, too important for the smoking crater and morning light. \"Your mother was looking for the same thing I've just been bound to find.\"\n\nFor a long moment, Vex was silent, her expression cycling through several emotions before settling on grim determination. \"Then I'm definitely coming with you. If the thing that killed my mother is connected to whatever's in your arm, I want to be there when we find it.\"\n\n\"It might not have been a thing that killed her,\" Caelin said quietly. \"The mountains are dangerous even without ancient conspiracies.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" Vex's hand drifted to one of her daggers, a habitual gesture that spoke of comfort rather than threat. \"But she was too good to die to something ordinary. Too careful. If something in those peaks took her, I need to know what. And I need to know if it's still there.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed steady and warm. No sting. Truth spoken plainly.\n\n\"We leave as soon as I can gather supplies from what's left of the village,\" Caelin said. \"The path leads east toward the Emberpeaks. The dragon said there's a sanctum there—the First Sanctum, she called it. That's where we're going.\"\n\n\"We.\" Vex's mouth twitched into something almost like a smile. \"Look at that. Partnership established through mutual desperation and probable doom. My favorite kind.\"\n\n\"I should warn you,\" Caelin added, looking down at the scale embedded in his arm, watching the ember-motes drift in its translucent depths. \"This thing has rules. It punishes lies. Forces truth. I'm not entirely in control of what I might say anymore.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Vex said, surprising him. \"Lies get people killed. I'd rather travel with someone who can't lie than someone I have to constantly second-guess.\" She glanced at the dragon's body, her expression softening slightly. \"Besides, after watching what just happened—whatever that was—I think we're past the point where normal rules apply.\"\n\nThey stood in the crater's heart, the morning sun climbing higher, burning away the last of the smoke. The flame-path stretched toward distant peaks, visible only to Caelin's marked sight. The scale pulsed its steady rhythm against his skin.\n\n\"We should go,\" Vex said. \"Whatever was drawn by the dragon's fire might still be nearby. And I'd rather not explain to the villagers why I was watching from the shadows while their savior got magically branded.\"\n\n\"Fair point.\" Caelin took one last look at Vharisax—already transforming into monument, into legend, into the glass-frozen history of this place. \"Thank you,\" he said quietly, not entirely sure if he meant it for the burden or the purpose or simply for answering the question his entire life had been circling.\n\nThe dragon didn't answer. She'd said everything she needed to.\n\nThey climbed the crater's slope together, glass singing its low crystalline note beneath their boots. At the rim, Caelin paused, looking toward Thornwick's smoke and then toward the Emberpeaks' distant blue silhouette.\n\nBehind them, the dragon lay in her crater of transformed earth.\n\nAhead, the flame-path beckoned with patient, inexorable pull.\n\nAnd on his arm, the scale kept its steady count of heartbeats, marking time until destiny could no longer be delayed.",

The transformation was everywhere—glass-smooth walls that had been wood, crystalline puddles where water had boiled and frozen in the same instant, cobblestones fused into organic curves that caught light like gems.\n\nPeople stared as they passed. Not at Vex—she drew glances, certainly, with her mismatched eyes and road-worn bearing—but at Caelin. At his arm.\n\nHe'd rolled up his sleeve without thinking, too hot from the climb out of the crater. Now the embedded scale was visible to anyone who looked: that thumb-length hex of dark obsidian inlaid flush with his skin, the hair-fine filaments threading away from its edges like black veins beneath the surface. The ember-motes drifted lazily in the scale's depths, visible even in daylight.\n\n\"They're afraid,\" Vex murmured beside him.\n\n\"I saved a child,\" Caelin said, but even to his own ears it sounded hollow.\n\n\"You did. And then you went to meet a dragon and came back changed.\" She kept her voice low, conversational. \"People fear what they don't understand. And that—\" a subtle gesture at his arm \"—they definitely don't understand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. No sting. She was right, as usual.\n\nThey found Elder Gareth in the village square, directing a handful of survivors as they loaded a wagon with salvaged supplies. He looked up as they approached, his gaze going immediately to Caelin's exposed forearm.\n\nThe old man's eyes widened, then narrowed with something that might have been recognition.\n\n\"So,\" Gareth said quietly, straightening with effort. \"She marked you.\"\n\n\"You know what this is?\" Caelin asked, surprise and relief mixing in equal measure.\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember stories my grandmother told. Stories her grandmother told her.\" Gareth stepped closer, studying the scale without touching. \"The dragon-marked. The ember-born. The old songs spoke of them—those who carried fire in their blood and could be chosen as bearers for something greater.\" His voice dropped. \"I didn't think I'd live to see it proven true.\"\n\n\"The dragon—Vharisax—she said I have to find something. Nine somethings. Relics, she called them. And gather others who can bear them.\" The words tumbled out faster than intended. \"She said if I don't, something sealed beneath the mountains will wake. Something that shouldn't.\"\n\nGareth was quiet for a long moment, his weathered face unreadable. Then he nodded slowly. \"Then you'll go. You don't have a choice, do you?\"\n\nCaelin looked down at the scale. \"No. I really don't.\"\n\n\"The mark won't let you,\" Gareth said with certainty. \"It'll pull you toward what needs doing. Push you when you hesitate. Drag you if you try to run.\" He met Caelin's eyes. \"My grandmother said the dragon-marked were blessed and cursed in equal measure. The blessing: purpose absolute. The curse: no peace until that purpose is fulfilled.\"\n\n\"That's about right,\" Vex muttered.\n\nGareth turned his attention to her, assessing. \"And you are?\"\n\n\"Someone following him because he's following something I need to find.\" Vex's honesty was almost aggressive. \"My mother died in those mountains looking for whatever he's bound to seek. I'm going to find out why.\"\n\nThe elder nodded as if this made perfect sense. \"Then you'll watch his back while he watches the path. Good. He'll need someone practical.\" He turned back to Caelin. \"When do you leave?\"\n\n\"Today,\" Caelin said, though he hadn't consciously decided. The scale warmed in agreement. \"The path leads to the Emberpeaks. The sooner we follow it, the sooner...\" He trailed off, unsure how to finish.\n\n\"The sooner you can rest,\" Gareth finished for him. \"If you ever can.\" He clasped Caelin's shoulder with surprising strength. \"You saved my granddaughter. That's a debt Thornwick won't forget. If you need supplies, take them. If you need silver, we have a little. If you need a blessing—\" his voice roughened \"—you have mine. Go with purpose. Return with answers.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Caelin managed.\n\n\"Don't try. Do.\" Gareth's grip tightened. \"The dragon chose you for a reason. Trust that, when everything else fails.\"\n\nA small voice called out: \"Caelin!\"\n\nMira broke away from a group of children and ran toward them, her soot-stained dress flapping. She skidded to a stop in front of him, eyes wide and bright.\n\n\"You're leaving,\" she said. Not a question.\n\n\"I have to.\"\n\n\"Because of what the red lady gave you.\" Her gaze dropped to his arm, to the scale embedded there. She reached out one small hand, hesitated, then gently touched the obsidian surface with one fingertip.\n\nThe scale pulsed beneath her touch—a single bright flare of light that made the ember-motes swirl faster. Mira gasped but didn't pull away.\n\n\"It's warm,\" she whispered. \"Like a heartbeat.\"\n\n\"It is, in a way,\" Caelin said, his throat tight.\n\nMira pulled her hand back and looked up at him with an intensity that seemed too old for her age. \"The rhyme. The one the dragon sang. You're going to find what it talks about, aren't you? The Nine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you come back?\"\n\nThe question hit harder than expected. The scale stayed steady—it would let him answer honestly either way. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"The path is long. What I'm looking for is dangerous. But if I can...\" He stopped, tried again. \"I'll try.\"\n\nThe scale stung—sharp and bright. He winced.\n\nMira's eyes widened. \"It hurt you. Why did it hurt you?\"\n\n\"Because I wasn't being truthful enough.\" He knelt so they were eye-level. \"Let me try again. I don't know if I'll come back. What I'm doing might take years. It might take me to places I can't return from. But—\" and this he knew was true, felt it bone-deep \"—if I succeed, if I find what I'm meant to find, then places like Thornwick will be safer. Dragons won't come searching. Villages won't burn. Children won't lose their mothers.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. No sting. Truth accepted.\n\nMira nodded solemnly, then surprised him by wrapping her arms around his neck in a fierce hug. \"Then you have to succeed,\" she whispered against his shoulder. \"You have to.\"\n\n\"I will,\" he said, and hoped it wasn't a lie.\n\nWhen she pulled back, she was crying, but her chin was set with determination. \"I'll remember the rhyme. Every word. And when you come back, I'll say it to you again so you know I kept it safe.\"\n\n\"I'd like that.\"\n\nGareth gently called Mira back, and she went reluctantly, looking over her shoulder until she disappeared into the group of children being loaded onto the wagon.\n\n\"They're evacuating to Millbrook,\" Gareth said. \"The village council there owes us a debt from the grain shortages five years back. We'll rebuild. Someday.\" He looked around at the glass-transformed ruins. \"Or we'll build something new. Either way, we'll survive.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Caelin said. \"If I'd come sooner—\"\n\n\"You came when you could. You saved who you could.\" The elder's voice was firm. \"That's all anyone can ask. The rest is on the dragon, and she's answered for it.\"\n\nVex touched Caelin's arm—the unmarked one. \"We should go. Afternoon's burning, and I'd rather be in the foothills before dark. Less chance of running into whatever might be drawn by the dragon's death.\"\n\nShe was right. The scale pulsed agreement.\n\nCaelin looked around at Thornwick one last time—at the survivors, the transformed buildings, the smoke still rising from deeper ruins. He'd arrived at dawn to find catastrophe. He was leaving at midday carrying a burden he barely understood.\n\nBut the flame-path stretched before him, bright and insistent and impossible to ignore.\n\n\"Take this,\" Gareth said, pressing a small pouch into Caelin's hand. It clinked with coin. \"Not much, but enough to get you through the next few towns. And this—\" He pulled a folded piece of cloth from his pocket, opened it to reveal a simple silver pendant on a leather cord. \"My wife's. She'd want you to have it. For luck.\"\n\n\"I can't—\"\n\n\"You can, and you will.\" Gareth closed Caelin's fingers around it. \"Honor her memory by surviving whatever's ahead.\"\n\nCaelin nodded, unable to speak past the tightness in his throat.\n\nThey gathered what little they needed—dried meat, water skins, a spare cloak for Vex—and walked to the eastern edge of the village where the flame-path led. The thread of fire stretched across the fields toward where the land began its climb into the foothills.\n\nOnly Caelin could see it, but he felt its pull like a physical thing now, stronger with each passing moment. The scale pulsed in rhythm with it, urging him forward.\n\n\"So we just... walk toward the mountains?\" Vex asked. \"Following something only you can see?\"\n\n\"That's the plan.\"\n\n\"Terrible plan.\" But she adjusted her pack and checked her daggers. \"I've followed worse.\"\n\nThey set out together, leaving Thornwick's smoke behind. The flame-path stretched before them like a thread connecting present to uncertain future. Caelin kept his marked arm exposed—there was no point hiding it, and the scale seemed to pulse brighter when covered, as if objecting to concealment.\n\nAs they walked, the embedded scale kept time with his heartbeat, a steady rhythm that was both foreign and intimate. The filaments beneath his skin had settled into their patterns, no longer feeling like invasion but like something that had always been there, waiting.\n\nThe Emberpeaks grew larger on the horizon, their slopes darkening from blue to grey as afternoon light shifted. Somewhere in those mountains waited the First Sanctum. Somewhere ahead lay the Dragon's Ember, first of the Nine Relics.\n\nAnd somewhere beyond that—beyond the paths and purposes and ancient pacts—waited the thing that must never wake.\n\nBut that was future's problem. Present's problem was putting one foot in front of the other, following a path of fire only he could see, trusting a scale embedded in his flesh to guide him true.\n\n\"So,\" Vex said after they'd walked in silence for a while, \"what happens when we actually reach this sanctum? Do you have a plan?\"\n\n\"Find the relic. Don't die. Probably in that order.\"\n\n\"That's not a plan. That's barely even hope.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. No sting. It was the truth.\n\n\"It's what I have,\" Caelin said.\n\n\"Then I guess it'll have to be enough.\" Vex squinted toward the mountains. \"Though for the record, I still can't see anything except regular mountains and impending doom.\"\n\n\"The doom's definitely there.\"\n\n\"Fantastic.\" But there was something almost like humor in her voice. \"At least we're doomed together. That's practically a friendship.\"\n\nDespite everything—the weight of the mark, the magnitude of the task, the uncertainty of what lay ahead—Caelin found himself almost smiling.\n\nThe flame-path stretched onward. The scale pulsed steady. The mountains waited.\n\nAnd somewhere in the distance, something ancient stirred in its sleep, feeling the first link of the chain being forged anew.",

                "text": "Act I: Three Days Later\n\nThree days had passed since the dragon's death, and Thornwick still hadn't stopped smoking.\n\nCaelin had spent most of that time in fever dreams, his body fighting the scale’s invasion while his mind spiraled through visions he couldn’t hold. Even asleep, pain was his pulse—the scale burned, a low ember ache that never cooled. The bonding hadn’t been clean; it rewrote him from the inside out. He’d burned so hot that Vex packed him in snow from shaded hollows just to stop him smoking.\n\nBy the third morning, the fever broke.\n\nThe scale settled to its baseline: a thumb-length, hex-edged plate lying flush in his skin, translucent obsidian with ember-motes drifting inside, pulsing steady. The filaments had spread—not just toward wrist and elbow now, but creeping past the joint. Dark threads visible beneath skin that would never look quite normal again.\n\nHe flexed his fingers, testing. The embedded plate flexed with him. The filaments shifted like roots seeking deeper soil.\n\n“You look less on fire today,” Vex said from the doorway of the half-collapsed inn where they’d taken shelter. Her eyes didn’t match—one gold-hazel, one storm-grey—the only inheritance from a mother who’d spent her life studying magic she wasn’t supposed to touch. “Improvement or just denial?”.  She held a clay cup that steamed in the morning chill.\n\n\"A little.\" The truth came easier after three days of the scale punishing every half-lie his fever-addled mind had tried. \"Different now. Less like fire, more like... weight.\"\n\n\"The veins are spreading.\" Not a question. She'd been watching the progression, cataloging it with the same attention she gave potential threats and profitable opportunities.\n\nHe tugged his sleeve down. The cloth caught on the plate's raised edge—a small, stupid reminder he would never hide it for long. \n\nHe’d tested it that morning out of stubbornness—wrapped it, braced it, even tried steel.: linen wrappings had smoldered after an hour, and the leather bracer from the inn's abandoned supplies had conducted heat until it burned his skin, leaving blisters that still throbbed. Metal was worse—the scale had flared white-hot the moment steel touched it, as if offended by the attempt at concealment.\n\n\"Right,\" Vex said, watching the sleeve ride back up. \"Not ominous at all.\"\n\nShe handed him the cup—broth made from dried vegetables and questionable meat, but hot and real. \"Drink. You need to eat actual food today or you'll collapse halfway to wherever that magic compass in your arm wants to drag us.\"\n\nHe sipped. It tasted like survival—not good, but good enough. \"You stayed.\"“You didn’t have to,” he said, surprised how small his voice sounded.\n\n\"Investment protection.\" She settled against the opposite wall, her own cup cradled in scarred hands. \"Spent three days keeping you alive, forcing water down your throat when you tried to bite me, and listening to you speak fluent Draconic in your sleep—which was deeply unsettling, by the way. Would be wasteful to let you die now.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. No sting. Close enough to truth—she had stayed for practical reasons, even if other reasons were growing beneath the surface.\n\n\"The dreams,\" he said. \"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Nothing I could understand. But you said it with authority.\" Her mismatched eyes studied him. \"And that thing—\" a gesture at his arm \"—lit up the whole room every time you started. Like sleeping next to a forge that randomly decided to perform a light show.\"\n\nHe'd noticed. The scale answered emotion as much as magic: hesitation brought the white-hot sting; fever dreams brought the full prismatic display. He was learning to school his thoughts, to keep them surface-level and practical, to not think too deeply about what he'd become.\n\nThe scale warmed slightly. It knew what he was doing.\n\n\"We should go back,\" Caelin said, pushing to his feet. His legs protested but held. \"To the crater. I need to see it with clear eyes.\"\n\n\"Already scouted it twice.\" But Vex stood as well, checking her daggers from habit. \"Nothing's changed. Dragon's still dead and crystallized. Path still leads to the mountains. Village still looks like someone melted it into modern art.\"\n\n\"I need to see it anyway.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Your funeral. Or mine, probably, since I'm following you.\"\n\nThey left the inn as morning light turned the transformed village into something almost beautiful. Glass-smooth walls caught sun and threw rainbows. Crystalline puddles reflected sky in fractured mirrors. Even the destruction had an elegance to it—the way catastrophe sometimes does, when you're far enough away from the dying.\n\nPeople watched them pass. Fewer than before—half the survivors had already left for Millbrook, unable to stay in a place that wore its trauma like decoration. Those who remained were the stubborn or the broken, the ones with nowhere else to go or reasons to stay that outweighed sense.\n\nA woman carrying a child saw Caelin's exposed forearm and made a warding sign.\n\nAn old man simply stared, mouth working soundlessly.\n\n\"They're afraid,\" Vex murmured.\n\n\"I saved a child here.\"\n\n\"You did. Then you went to meet a dragon and came back changed.\" She kept her voice low. \"People fear what they don't understand. That—\" a subtle gesture \"—they definitely don't understand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm. She was right, as usual.\n\nThey followed the path of scorched hedge and melted stone toward the crater. The destruction formed a clear line—deliberate, purposeful—leading away from the village center. Morning mist clung to the hollows, making the landscape seem unreal, halfway between memory and present.\n\nWhere the hedgerow ended, the crater waited.\n\nShe was gone. Not crystallised, not preserved—gone entirely. The glass floor held only the ghost of her outline, a perfect dragon-shaped shadow scorched into the obsidian where ten thousand years of history had finally settled and gone dark. The ember-motes in Caelin’s scale drifted a little faster as he slid down the slope. He wondered if they knew.\n\n“What are you looking for?” Vex called from the rim.\n\n“I don’t know.” He crossed to the centre and crouched at the outline’s edge. The glass was warm here—just faintly, the last of it. His marked arm pulsed once in recognition, amber light catching nothing.\n\n“Thank you,” he said quietly, not sure if it was gratitude or accusation. Maybe both.\n\nThe glass didn’t answer.\n\nFootsteps crunched above—not Vex, different rhythm. Caelin turned, hand moving instinctively toward the sword he'd left at the inn.\n\nA figure crested the crater's rim from the north side—short, broad, trailing a small cloud of steam and the unmistakable tick-tick-whirr of clockwork in motion. Even at a distance, the mechanical clicking carried across the glass-smooth bowl with crystal clarity.\n\n\"That's either the world's loudest thief,\" Vex called down, daggers already in hand, \"or a very confused tinker.\"\n\nThe figure resolved as it descended: a dwarf, copper beard braided with gear-charms that glinted in the light, goggles pushed up on a wild-browed forehead revealing keen eyes beneath. A pack that seemed more metal than leather rode his shoulders, bristling with tools and devices and things that hummed. He stopped twenty feet away, tilted his head at Caelin like a bird examining something shiny, and beamed with the particular joy of someone proving themselves right after a long argument.\n\n\"Aha!\" The dwarf's voice carried genuine delight. \"Knew the readings couldn't be wrong. Well, they're usually wrong, but not about this. Never about this.\"\n\nHe unslung a brass contraption from his shoulder—a brass contraption of spinning dials and trembling needles that twisted light in uneasy patterns. He pointed it at Caelin.\n\nThe device screamed.\n\nNot metaphorically—literally shrieked, a high metallic wail that sent birds scattering from the crater's rim and made Caelin's teeth ache.\n\nThe dwarf slapped it. The screaming became sparking. He slapped it again. Silence, except for an ominous ticking that suggested the device was either thinking or plotting revenge.\n\n\"Brilliant,\" he told the device with genuine affection. Then, to them: \"Thornik Bramblebrew. Artificer, engineer, and occasional brewer of exploding ale—though that last bit's more accident than intention. You're the Ember-born, unless my instruments are lying. Which they don't, except when they do, but not about dragon-marks. Never about dragon-marks.\"\n\nThornik's eyes went wide behind his pushed-up goggles. \"By my beard.\" His voice dropped to something like reverence. \"It recognized my kit.\"\n\nHe took a step closer, goggles sliding down over his eyes with a mechanical snick. The lenses whirred, adjusting, magnifying. \"May I? Grandfather wrote about this—well, he wrote in blood, technically, which was dramatic even for him—but if the resonance patterns match what he described, if the harmonic frequencies align, if the—\"\n\nVex shifted between them—not blocking entirely, but making her presence felt. \"Maybe ask before reaching for things embedded in people's arms. Novel concept, I know.\"\n\nThornik held up both hands, device still humming. \"Fair, fair. Wouldn't want to interfere with an active bonding anyway. Could cause sympathetic feedback loops.\" He paused, considering. \"Or explosions. Fifty-fifty odds, really, and explosions are only fun when they're intentional.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Caelin said, instinctively covering the scale with his other hand. It pulsed warmer, as if objecting to being hidden even by his own flesh.\n\n\"What brings an artificer to a burned village?\" Vex asked, still wary, still positioned to strike if needed.\n\n\"Same thing that brought him, I'd wager.\" Thornik's enthusiasm dimmed slightly, replaced by something heavier—old grief wearing new clothes. \"The dreams. My whole clan's been having them for months. Forges waking in the deep places where we sealed them. Constructs stirring in halls we'd forgotten. The old songs starting up again in chambers we'd filled with stone and regret.\"\n\nHe gestured at the dragon's crystalline corpse, at the transformed crater, at the morning light making art of catastrophe. \"Then three nights ago—the exact night she died—every piece of sensing equipment in Deepstone Hold went mad at once. Every dial spinning. Every alarm screaming. Every blessed instrument pointing here, at this spot, saying 'something fundamental just changed.'\"\n\nThornik pulled a water-stained journal from his coat—leather gone soft with age and handling, pages brittle at the edges, stained with substances that might have been blood or oil or tears. \"My grandfather died believing himself a fool for chasing legends. Spent his last gold on an expedition into the Emberpeaks, came back empty-handed and broken-spirited. Wrote in this—in his own blood, mind you, because apparently sanity's optional in our family—about hearing old songs, about seeing the pedestals of the Nine, about...\"\n\nHe trailed off, shook his head, but his hands clutched the journal like it might escape. \"About warnings. Prices paid. Choices that haunt. He died thinking he'd failed. That he'd missed something vital. That he'd doomed us all by not understanding fast enough.\"\n\nThe dwarf's eyes met Caelin's, and the weight there aged him. \"Point is, if he was right about any of it—if even one page of his mad rambling was true—then everything changes. The old alliances weren't myths. The Concord wasn't legend. And whatever's waking now...\" He glanced at the scale in Caelin's arm. \"It's already started.\"\n\nThe scale flared hot for just a moment—not pain, but insistence. Share it. Tell him. The dragon had said to find others, to gather bearers. This dwarf had come seeking the same truth. His grandfather had died chasing it.\n\nCaelin hated that the scale was probably right.\n\n\"The dragon spoke of nine relics,\" he said, the words feeling too large for the smoking crater and morning light. \"Forged in concordance. Nine bearers to claim them. And something beneath stone—something called the Seal—that has to stay sleeping.\"\n\nThornik's face cycled through several emotions in rapid succession: shock, vindication, terror, and finally settling on manic determination. \"The Concord of Nine. Gods and ancestors and all the stone beneath, he was right.\"\n\nHe opened the journal with trembling hands, pages crackling. \"Grandfather wrote about it. The great alliance—dragons and dwarves forging together, nine artifacts to maintain the balance, one for each school of magic. But there were warnings too. About prices. About sacrifices. About—\" his voice dropped \"—about what happens if the balance breaks.\"\n\n\"What happens?\" Vex asked, climbing down into the crater now, curiosity overriding caution.\n\nThornik looked up from the journal, and his expression was bleak. \"He didn't write it. Just left blank pages with one phrase: 'May none live to learn the answer.'\"\n\nSilence stretched between them, broken only by the soft ticking of Thornik's devices and the distant sound of Thornwick's survivors going about the grim business of salvage and departure.\n\nThe scale pulsed steady in Caelin's arm—counting heartbeats, marking time, waiting for whatever came next.",

                "text": "Act II: Divine Fracture\n\nA sound from the crater's rim made them all turn—the clink of metal on stone, deliberate and measured. Not the mechanical clicking of Thornik's devices but something heavier. Purposeful.\n\nA horse stood at the crater's edge, steam rising from its flanks. Its rider dismounted with practiced ease, though Caelin noted the stiffness in her movements—old injuries, poorly healed, the kind that never quite stopped aching.\n\nShe wore armor that had once been white and gold but now looked sun-bleached and road-worn, the kind of patina that came from months in the saddle without proper maintenance. Not from neglect, he realized, but from lack of time—or perhaps lack of caring about appearances when survival took precedence.\n\n\"I'm looking for Elder Gareth,\" she called down, her voice carrying the formal cadence of someone used to announcing themselves in halls of power. Then her gaze landed on Caelin's exposed forearm—the sleeve had ridden up again during his conversation with Thornik—and she stopped mid-sentence.\n\nThe scale reacted immediately.\n\nNot the white-hot sting of lies or the prismatic shimmer of wild magic. This was different—a steady, golden-ember glow that Caelin had never seen before. The light pulsed from the embedded plate like a heartbeat made visible, warm and... welcoming? No, not quite. Recognizing.\n\nThe woman's hand moved to her sword hilt—not in threat but in reflex—and her palm began to glow. Soft silver-gold light flickered across her skin like a candle struggling in wind, uncertain but persistent.\n\n\"What are you?\" she asked, and the question held no accusation, only genuine need to understand.\n\n\"Cursed,\" Caelin said, because it felt more honest than \"chosen.\"\n\n\"Dragon-marked,\" Thornik added helpfully, his device already whirring as it tracked the interaction. \"First verified case in three generations. Possibly longer. My readings indicate a stable harmonic resonance between—\"\n\n\"I wasn't asking you.\" But her grip on the sword relaxed fractionally. The light in her palm didn't fade, but it steadied somewhat, silver and gold still dancing their uneasy dance but no longer quite so frantic.\n\nShe descended into the crater with care, testing each step on the glass slope before committing her weight. Up close, Caelin could see the exhaustion in her face—the kind that went deeper than lack of sleep, that spoke of questions without answers and certainty turned to sand.\n\n\"Serana Valeblade,\" she said, the formality a shield or perhaps just habit. \"Paladin of the Silver Dawn. I came to offer aid to the survivors, but...\" She looked around at the glass-fused crater, the crystalline dragon, the morning light making art of devastation. \"This is beyond healing. This is divine reckoning.\"\n\n\"Just dragon fire,\" Vex said from where she leaned against the crater wall, affecting casual despite the tension in her shoulders. \"Very enthusiastic dragon fire, admittedly, but nothing divine about it.\"\n\n\"You're wrong.\" Serana's voice carried absolute certainty—the kind that came from hearing gods speak. Then that certainty cracked, and something raw showed through. \"At least... I think you're wrong. I used to be sure. Now...\"\n\nShe closed her eyes briefly, and when she opened them, the exhaustion was even clearer. \"Since the dragon’s death my god speaks with two voices—one preaching mercy, one sacrifice. I used to know which was truth. Now I don’t.\"\n\nShe looked at Caelin, at the scale pulsing its steady golden rhythm in time with her flickering light. \"So I came seeking answers. Or at least clarity. Someone who could tell me if my god has fractured or if I have.\" Her jaw set. \"Instead I find... that.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed again—ember and silver-gold, fire and holy radiance, beating in an alternating pattern like a shared heartbeat. One pulse of gold from the scale, one flicker of silver from her palm, back and forth in perfect synchronization.\n\n\"The gods know,\" Thornik breathed, watching the synchronized pulsing with wide eyes. His device had stopped its usual clicking and settled into a low, resonant hum. \"They know what's waking. That's why her guidance splits—divine will fracturing under the weight of impossible choices.\"\n\n\"What choices?\" Serana demanded, her hand dropping from her sword to press against her chest where the Silver Dawn's symbol hung. \"What could possibly justify telling a paladin to both protect and sacrifice? To both shepherd and... and cull?\"\n\n\"The Concord,\" Thornik said quietly, and suddenly all the manic energy had drained from him, leaving only the weight of inherited knowledge. \"Grandfather wrote about it in the margins. The old alliance required... balance. Sometimes protection meant destruction. Sometimes healing meant cutting away the infected flesh before it could spread.\"\n\nHe looked at Serana with something like sympathy. \"Your god isn't fracturing, lady paladin. Your god is preparing you for choices where both commands will be true at once. Where protecting some means sacrificing others. Where keeping the greater balance requires breaking lesser ones.\"\n\n\"That's not—\" Serana started, then stopped. The silver-gold light in her palm flared brighter for a moment, as if in confirmation, and she looked at it with something between betrayal and understanding. \"That's not the Silver Dawn's teaching. We don't trade lives like currency. We don't choose who deserves protection and who doesn't.\"\n\n\"Maybe you didn't have to before,\" Vex said, surprisingly gentle. \"Maybe the choices were always clear enough that mercy and pragmatism pointed the same direction. But if something's changing—if something sealed is waking—maybe the easy choices are over.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warmer in Caelin's arm, but didn't sting. Truth, whether welcome or not.\n\nSerana was quiet for a long moment, staring at her glowing palm, at the scale answering it with golden light, at the dragon's crystalline corpse bearing silent witness to transformation and consequence.\n\n\"What did she tell you?\" Serana asked finally, looking at Caelin. \"The dragon. Before she died. What did she say was coming that could fracture divine guidance itself?\"\n\nCaelin flexed his marked arm, feeling the filaments shift beneath skin, the embedded plate counting heartbeats with patient precision. \"She said nine relics were forged to maintain balance. That nine bearers are needed to claim them. And that something called the Tenth—something sealed beneath stone—has to stay sleeping.\" He met her eyes. \"She said if the Nine fail, if the balance breaks, then what's buried will wake. And it's wrong for the breathing world.\"\n\n\"The Tenth,\" Serana repeated, and her silver-gold light guttered like a candle in wind. \"My prayers this morning... when I asked what I should do, what path I should follow... the answer came in two voices.\" She swallowed hard. \"One said find the Nine, keep the chain. The other said some chains deserve breaking.\"\n\n\"Which voice was louder?\" Thornik asked.\n\n\"Neither. Both. They spoke over each other, equally strong, equally certain.\" She looked lost. \"How do I serve my god when my god speaks with two mouths?\"\n\n\"You choose,\" Vex said bluntly. \"You pick which voice sounds more like the deity you swore to serve, and you follow that one. The other voice—\" she shrugged \"—might not be your god at all. Might be something else trying to sound like it.\"\n\nThe scale flared white-hot against Caelin's skin—sudden, searing. He gasped, cradling his arm.\n\n\"What?\" Vex spun toward him. \"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Not you.\" He gritted his teeth against the pain. \"The scale. It's warning—\"\n\nThe obsidian plate shifted, and for the first time since bonding, black-violet bled through the translucent surface like ink in water. The ember-motes inside swirled faster, agitated, and the pulse went irregular—fast, then slow, then hard.\n\n\"Corruption warning,\" Thornik said, his device suddenly screaming again. He slapped it silent and checked the dials with growing alarm. \"Three signatures. No, four. Strong ones. Closing fast from different vectors.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" Serana's hand went back to her sword, and this time she drew it. Silver-gold light cascaded down the blade like liquid sunrise.\n\n\"If I'm reading this right?\" Thornik's voice had lost all its cheer. \"Whatever was drawn here after the dragon died. Whatever's been hunting these mountains for something it can finally smell.\"\n\nThe scale's black-violet bloom intensified. The irregular pulse hammered against Caelin's nerves—wrong wrong wrong in a rhythm that made his teeth ache.\n\n\"And these readings...\" Thornik tapped his device as if hoping it was malfunctioning. \"These don't match anything living.\"\n\nA scream rose from the direction of the village—sharp, terrified, and cut short with sickening abruptness.\n\nThey ran.\n\nBoots on glass, then dirt, then cobblestone still warm from dragon-fire three days old. The transformed village seemed to resist their passage, crystalline surfaces slick and treacherous, fused walls creating dead ends where paths used to run.\n\nThe scale's black-violet warning pulsed harder with each step, and Caelin felt something he hadn't felt since the bonding: fear not his own. The scale was afraid. Or warning him to be. Or both.\n\nThey burst into the village square and stopped.\n\nA figure stood over the fallen—someone Caelin recognized, vaguely, from three days ago. A trader, maybe, or a traveler who'd come seeking news of the dragon and found catastrophe instead. The body was intact, clothes recognizable, face still human.\n\nBut the eyes were wrong.\n\nBlack from lid to lid. No white, no iris—just obsidian darkness that reflected no light and seemed to drink the morning sun.\n\nAnd the shadow.\n\nGods, the shadow.\n\nIt moved independent of the figure, stretching and bending in directions that had nothing to do with where the light fell. Tendrils of darkness writhed around the figure's feet, tasting the air like serpents, reaching toward the living with obvious hunger.\n\nThornik's device had stopped screaming and started weeping—a low, mournful tone that resonated in Caelin's chest, in his bones, in the scale's frantic black-violet pulse.\n\nThe corrupted figure turned toward them with liquid grace, head tilting at an angle just wrong enough to trigger every instinct that said predator. When it spoke, three voices emerged braided together—the person it had been, something ancient and cold, and underneath both, the sound like stone grinding stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" it said, and smiled with too many teeth. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\nTwo more emerged from between buildings—moving with that same wrong fluidity, shadows writhing like living things, black eyes drinking light.\n\n\"Behind the wagons!\" Elder Gareth's voice bellowed from across the square. \"Get the children behind the wagons!\"\n\nSerana's sword flared brighter, silver-gold light casting hard shadows. \"Positions!\"\n\nThe scale's black-violet bloom filled Caelin's entire forearm, pulsing so hard it hurt. And beneath the warning, beneath the fear, something else:\n\nPurpose.\n\nThe Dragon's Ember stirred in his chest—not called, not yet, but ready. Waiting for the moment when warning became action, when fear became fuel.\n\nThe shadow-thralls took a step forward, moving in perfect synchronization.\n\n\"Three of them,\" Vex said, daggers appearing in her hands like magic tricks. \"Four of us. I've had worse odds.\"\n\n\"Five,\" Serana corrected, stepping forward with her blade held steady despite the fear Caelin could see in her eyes. \"Stay behind me.\"\n\nThornik set his pack down with surprising gentleness, and when he stood again, he held a fat brass cylinder in one hand and had reached back to unhook the twin axes from his shoulders. \"Right then,\" he said, and his voice held something almost like joy beneath the terror. \"Let's see if Grandfather's warnings were complete. Avert your eyes, lovely people.\"\n\nThe shadow-thralls smiled their too-wide smiles and charged.",

                "text": "Act III: Baptism by Fire\n\nThe fight was short and ugly.\n\nSerana hit first—training overriding fear, muscle memory carrying her forward when thought might have frozen her. Her blade traced an arc of silver-gold light that cut through the air like a falling star, and where it met shadow-tether, the darkness screamed.\n\nNot metaphorically. The shadows shrieked with voices that shouldn't exist, writhing away from the divine radiance like living things recoiling from fire. The thrall she'd struck staggered, its movements suddenly uncoordinated, as if strings had been cut.\n\n\"The light severs them!\" Serana called, her voice steady despite the horror. \"Aim for the shadows, not the bodies!\"\n\nThe corrupted figure knitted itself back together wrong—limbs jerking, spine bending in directions spines shouldn't bend—but it was slower now, damaged, the black in its eyes boiling like tar on summer stone.\n\nThornik didn't wait for a second demonstration. He snapped a rune on the brass cylinder's base and hurled it into the gap between two thralls. It clattered across cobblestone with a sound like manic laughter—tick-tick-tick—and detonated.\n\nThe explosion wasn't fire. It was force—a concussive whump that picked up loose debris and flung it outward in a perfect sphere. Shockwave, grit, and a flash bright enough to paint shadows on walls. The thralls flinched back, shadows fragmenting, bodies stumbling.\n\n\"Ha!\" Thornik bellowed, already reaching for his axes. \"That's the good batch! Patent pending! Please don't steal my design!\"\n\nVex didn't waste breath on commentary. She slid in low while the thralls were still reeling from Thornik's blast, moving with the fluid economy of someone who'd learned to fight in alleys where hesitation meant death. Two quick strikes—precise, surgical, merciless.\n\nHamstring on the first. The thrall's leg buckled, dropping it to one knee.\n\nKidney on the second as it turned toward her. The blade found the gap between ribs like it had eyes of its own.\n\n\"Less talking,\" she said, already spinning away from the third thrall's grasping reach. \"More dying. Preferably them, not us.\"\n\nThe third thrall lunged past Serana's guard, moving faster than something that broken should manage, straight for Caelin.\n\nThe scale ignited.\n\nNot with warning this time. With demand. The black-violet corruption bloom inverted instantly—from warning to weapon, fear to fuel. Heat surged up Caelin's arm, into his chest, and the Dragon's Ember answered.\n\nHe raised his right hand—instinct, not thought—and called fire.\n\nDragonfire came.\n\nNot the careful flames he'd shaped to save Mira, but something older. Rawer. A focused cone of heat that turned the air glass-hot and sent the thrall reeling backward, skin blistering, shadow shrieking as it burned.\n\nThe thrall's movements became frantic, uncoordinated. Whatever was puppeting the body didn't understand fire—or perhaps remembered it too well, knew it from before stone and sealing and the long dark beneath mountains.\n\nThen the cost hit.\n\nThe scale flared white-hot—pain branding every nerve—then cycled through prismatic light to an angry red that hammered with his pulse. Vision tunneled, breath coming ragged.\n\nHe'd pushed too hard, used too much, let the Ember have too free a rein.\n\nPain tore up his arm in waves, each pulse worse than the last. His knees started to buckle.\n\nSerana stepped through him—literally shoulder-checked him backward out of the line of engagement—and brought her blade down in a clean arc that finished the staggered thrall. Silver-gold light washed through the thing's center, and it fell in pieces that began dissolving into smoke before they hit ground.\n\nThornik met the last thrall with a roar and axes—no gadgets now, just dwarf-forged steel and ancestral fury. The first axe bit through a corrupted shoulder. The second took it in the side. \"Back to the pit with ye!\"\n\nThe thrall collapsed, shadows fragmenting like shattered glass.\n\nThey stood in the scorched square, panting, as silence fell heavy and absolute. Around them: smoke, crying from somewhere distant, the groan of a damaged wagon axle, the smell of charred flesh and something else—something chemical and wrong, like copper mixed with rot.\n\nCaelin sank to his knees, cradling his marked arm. The scale pulsed its angry red throb, counting the cost of power used too desperately. Each pulse sent fresh agony through the filaments. He'd known there would be pain—the dragon had warned him—but knowing and experiencing were different countries entirely.\n\n\"Breathe,\" Serana said, kneeling beside him but not touching—as if she understood that contact would only make it worse. \"The backlash will fade. Just breathe through it.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" he managed through gritted teeth.\n\n\"I don't. But it's what I'd want someone to tell me.\" Her honesty was almost comforting.\n\nVex was already checking the fallen bodies—quick, professional, making sure the dead stayed dead. \"These were people,\" she said, and something in her voice was harder than usual. \"Probably from the refugee caravans. Maybe from Thornwick itself.\"\n\n\"Not people anymore,\" Thornik said grimly, wiping his axes on a piece of torn cloth. He bent to examine his device, which had finally stopped its mournful weeping. \"Shadow corruption. Seal-touched, if Grandfather's notes are accurate. The thing beneath uses them like... like tools. Puppets with meat.\"\n\nHe looked up, and his expression was bleak. \"And these weren't scouts. My readings show they were lures.\"\n\n\"Lures for what?\" Serana asked, though her tone suggested she already knew the answer wouldn't be good.\n\n\"For whatever's coming next. To see who answers. To see who can fight.\" Thornik tapped a dial that still spun lazily. \"And we just showed it exactly what we're capable of.\"\n\n\"Meaning more will come,\" Vex finished. She stood, daggers still in hand, scanning the ruined square like she expected attack from every shadow. \"They always do. News travels fast among monsters.\"\n\nElder Gareth emerged from behind a wagon, two children clutched in the crooks of his arms, his face grey with exhaustion and fear. Other survivors followed—perhaps twenty in total, those who hadn't fled yet or couldn't, clinging to each other and what remained of their home.\n\n\"We cannot hold this place,\" Gareth said, and the words seemed to cost him. \"If they followed the dragon's fire, if they're drawn by what you carry—\" his eyes found Caelin's still-glowing scale \"—they'll follow you. And we cannot survive another attack.\"\n\nThe flame-path flared at the edge of Caelin's vision, suddenly visible despite the pain, tugging like a hooked nerve toward the Emberpeaks. Had it always pulled this insistently, or had claiming his attention in front of threats made it more demanding?\n\n\"You want us to leave,\" Caelin said. Not a question.\n\n\"I want you to lead them away.\" Gareth's voice was firm despite the tremor in his hands. \"Draw whatever's hunting you toward the mountains, away from the caravan route to Millbrook. Give us time to evacuate what's left.\"\n\n\"That's—\" Serana started, then stopped. Her silver-gold light flickered uncertainly. \"That's asking them to walk into danger to protect strangers.\"\n\n\"I'm asking them to do what they were going to do anyway.\" Gareth looked at each of them in turn. \"The mark pulls him. The path leads to the mountains. His purpose isn't here—it's forward, toward whatever the dragon bound him to find.\" His gaze settled on Caelin. \"Am I wrong?\"\n\nThe scale pulsed warm agreement. No sting. The old man was right—Caelin would follow the flame-path regardless. The only question was whether he'd lead danger toward innocents or away from them.\n\n\"No,\" Caelin admitted, pushing to his feet despite the lingering pain. \"You're not wrong.\"\n\n\"Then go. Today. Now, before more come.\" Gareth shifted the children in his arms, their faces buried against his shoulders. \"We'll head south to Millbrook. You head east to the Emberpeaks. Separate paths mean separate targets.\"\n\n\"He's not wrong,\" Vex said quietly. \"Strategically sound. Cold, but sound.\"\n\nThornik was already shouldering his pack, checking straps and buckles with practiced efficiency. \"Been planning to head that direction anyway. My instruments have been screaming about something in those mountains since this all started. Might as well investigate with company instead of dying alone and unmourned.\"\n\n\"I came seeking answers,\" Serana said slowly, her hand on her sword hilt, her divine light still flickering between commands. \"Perhaps the answers aren't here. Perhaps they're where you're going.\" She looked at Caelin. \"If my god's guidance splits over the Nine, then maybe I need to see the Nine myself to understand which voice to follow.\"\n\n\"So we're doing this,\" Vex said. \"Following the glowing destiny road into certain danger based on a dead dragon's cryptic instructions. Grand.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed steady now—the angry red had faded to something closer to its baseline coal-glow, though the filaments still ached. The black-violet corruption warning had dissipated entirely with the thralls' destruction, but Caelin knew it would return. The Seal knew they were coming now. It had tasted their power and found them wanting to test again.\n\n\"We leave within the hour,\" Caelin said, and even he heard how his voice had changed—less question, more command. The scale approved with a pulse of warmth. \"Gather what supplies you can. Travel light but prepare for weather and combat both.\"\n\n\"Listen to him giving orders,\" Vex murmured, but there was something almost fond beneath the sarcasm. \"Three days with a magic tattoo and he thinks he's a commander.\"\n\n\"The mark commands,\" Thornik said, surprisingly serious. \"He's just learning to speak its language.\"\n\nThey dispersed to prepare—Thornik to check his devices, Serana to tend the wounded one last time before departing, Vex to \"acquire\" whatever supplies the village could spare and wouldn't miss.\n\nCaelin stood in the square as survivors began loading wagons, the work of evacuation resuming around him like he was a stone in a stream. He looked at his marked arm, at the scale that had settled back to its steady pulse, at the filaments mapping his skin in dark tracery.\n\nMira appeared at his elbow—silent as a ghost, still clutching his ruined cloak from three days ago. She looked up at him with eyes too old for her age.\n\n\"You're leaving,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to.\"\n\n\"Because of what the dragon gave you.\" Not a question. She reached out and touched the scale with one small fingertip, and it pulsed gentle warmth—the first time since the fight it hadn't caused pain.\n\n\"Will you keep the rhyme safe?\" Caelin asked. \"The one the dragon sang?\"\n\n\"Every word,\" she promised. \"And when you come back, I'll say it for you again so you remember why you left.\"\n\n\"If I come back.\"\n\nThe scale stung. White-hot, sharp, brief.\n\nMira's eyes widened, but she didn't pull her finger away. \"It wants you to tell the truth,\" she said with a child's directness.\n\n\"It does.\"\n\n\"Then tell the truth.\"\n\nHe knelt so they were eye-level. \"I don't know if I'll come back. The path is long and leads to dangerous places. But if I do what I'm meant to do—if I find what I'm meant to find—then places like Thornwick will be safer. Children won't lose their homes. Dragons won't come searching.\"\n\nThe scale stayed warm. Truth accepted.\n\nMira hugged him with fierce strength, then pulled back and pressed something into his hand—a river stone, worn smooth, with a hole through its center. \"For luck. Papa said stones with holes are lucky because they've been blessed by water long enough to let light through.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, closing his fingers around it. The stone was warm from her pocket, smooth and real and ordinary in the best way.\n\nShe ran back to the wagons before he could say more, and he watched her go—another person he was leaving behind, another reason to succeed written in the set of a child's shoulders.\n\nAn hour later, they assembled at the eastern edge of the village where the flame-path pulled strongest. Five of them now—Caelin, Vex, Thornik, Serana, and their packs of hastily gathered supplies. Behind them, Thornwick smoked and evacuated. Ahead, the Emberpeaks rose blue and distant and patient.\n\nThe flame-path stretched clear and bright in Caelin's sight, unmistakable as a road paved with light only he could see.\n\n\"So we just walk toward the mountains,\" Vex said. \"Following something invisible.\"\n\n\"That's the plan,\" Caelin confirmed.\n\n\"Terrible plan.\" But she adjusted her pack and checked her daggers one more time. \"I've followed worse.\"\n\nSerana touched the symbol at her throat, lips moving in silent prayer. When she opened her eyes, the silver-gold light flickered but held steady. \"Together then. For whatever answers wait ahead.\"\n\n\"For answers,\" Thornik agreed. \"And for Grandfather's vindication, may the old fool rest easier knowing he wasn't mad after all.\"\n\nThey set out together, leaving Thornwick's smoke behind. The flame-path led them across fields where ash still drifted, toward foothills that climbed into mysteries older than kingdoms.\n\nThe scale pulsed its steady rhythm against Caelin's skin—counting breaths, marking steps, pulling him inexorably forward.\n\nBehind them, Elder Gareth watched from the last wagon, one hand raised in blessing or farewell.\n\nAhead, the mountains waited with patient, geological indifference.\n\n“Five people,” Vex said, not quite to anyone. “Following a road only one of us can see.”\n\n“Seven,” Thornik corrected, patting his pack. “Grandfather’s notes count.”\n\nNobody argued. The flame-path led on. They followed.",

                "text": "Act I: The Forest's Pain\n\nBy noon the road had dwindled to a rutted track, then to a pair of deer paths stitched together by stubborn feet. Bracken scraped their knees as they climbed. The mountains shouldered closer with every mile, their slopes darkening from blue to grey as the sun climbed higher. The air grew thinner, sharper, carrying the green smell of pine resin and something metallic underneath—stone dust, maybe, or the tang of old snow melting in hidden clefts.\n\nCaelin walked at the front because the flame-path only he could see demanded it. The thread of fire was thin as wire in the air, tugging toward the Emberpeaks with patient, inexorable pull. The scale pulsed its steady coal-glow against his forearm, warm enough to feel through fabric when his sleeve rode down. \n\nFour of us now, he thought, glancing back at the others spread along the trail. Three people following me toward something I don't understand, trusting a dragon's dying words and a mark I didn't ask for.\n\nThe thought of them following still felt strange. They owed him nothing, yet they kept pace. If the dragon’s words proved false, he’d only have wasted their time—still more guilt than he wanted to carry for strangers.\n\nVex moved like shadow behind him, quiet and watchful, her mismatched eyes scanning the tree line with professional paranoia. She'd been subdued since leaving Thornwick, speaking only when necessary, and Caelin wondered if she was regretting her decision to follow. But she hadn't turned back. Hadn't even suggested it.\n\nThornik came next, his pack clicking and whirring with every step, occasionally stopping to check a device or adjust a strap. He hummed under his breath—old dwarf mining songs, probably, though Caelin didn't recognize the melodies. The sound should have been cheerful. Instead it felt like whistling past graves.\n\nSerana brought up the rear, armored and alert despite the exhaustion that lined her face. Her hand never strayed far from her sword hilt. Occasionally her lips moved in what might have been prayer, but no divine light answered. The silver-gold flicker that had synchronized with his scale during the fight was gone, leaving only silence and the creak of worn leather.\n\nShe caught him looking and offered a small, tight smile that didn’t reach her eyes. Her palm rested for a moment against the Silver Dawn’s symbol at her throat. The light that had answered her sword in Thornwick—that silver-gold radiance she’d wielded like a second blade—stayed dark. She dropped her hand and kept walking.\n\nI’m dragging them into something I don’t understand, he thought, and the scale warmed fractionally but didn’t sting.\n\nThey found the wrongness where the flame-path crossed an older trail beneath a canopy of oaks.\n\nThe trees should have been green. It was summer, full leaf season, when the forest wore its heaviest dress. Instead the oaks looked like they were dying from the inside out—leaves spotted with black and crisping at the edges, bark peeling in long spirals to expose pale wood underneath that looked almost diseased. Roots had heaved out of the soil in grotesque tangles, as if something beneath had tried to crawl free and failed.\n\nThe air here smelled wrong. Sweet rot underneath the pine—like fruit left too long in summer heat, or meat beginning to turn. Caelin's stomach turned with it.\n\n\"Corruption,\" Thornik said, his device suddenly clicking faster. \"Magical blight. The Weave's been damaged here—torn, maybe, or poisoned. Nothing natural about this.\"\n\n\"How recent?\" Vex asked, hand on a dagger hilt as she scanned the dying trees.\n\nThornik adjusted his goggles, peering at readings that meant nothing to Caelin. \"Weeks, maybe. Growing steadily. Whatever caused it is still active, still spreading.\" He glanced at Caelin. \"Probably spreading from the same source that's pulling you forward.\"\n\n\"The sanctum,\" Serana said quietly. \"If the Dragon's Ember is waking, if the First Sanctum is activating after centuries dormant, it would affect the natural world around it. Magic this old doesn't wake gently.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed agreement—steady, warm, confirming what he already feared. They were walking toward the source of the corruption, drawn by the same force that was killing the forest.\n\nMore blood on my hands, Caelin thought. Even the trees can't escape what I'm bringing.\n\nA sound made them all freeze—footsteps, deliberate and unhurried, coming from the trail ahead where it curved through the dying oaks.\n\nA woman stepped out from between the trees and stood in their path.\n\nShe wore a cloak the color of lichen, grey-green and alive, and a circlet of vine that bloomed with each breath. Moss-ink tattoos curled down her arms, pulsing faintly—life answering something older than her heartbeat.\n\nHer eyes were brown, clear, and full of a grief so steady it had settled into patience.\n\nShe looked at them—at Vex's ready daggers, at Thornik's clicking devices, at Serana's armored vigilance—and then her gaze found Caelin. Found the scale in his forearm. And stopped.\n\n\"The forest screams,\" she said, with no preamble and no apology. Her voice carried the kind of calm that came from accepting terrible truths. \"Something tears the Weave at its roots. I feel it dying with every step I take.\"\n\n“Another stray,” she murmured, just loud enough for him to hear. “We keep collecting them. At this rate we’ll need a cart.”\n\n\"We don't mean harm,\" Serana said, stepping forward with palms open in universal peace. \"We're bound for the mountains. If you need aid—\"\n\n\"We're going to the same place,\" the woman interrupted, stepping past the paladin as if drawn by invisible thread. She stopped directly in front of Caelin, studying the scale with an intensity that made him want to step back. Her gaze traced the hex-edged plate, the hair-fine filaments webbing beneath his skin, the ember-motes drifting in translucent depths.\n\nThe embedded plate pulsed before she’d finished speaking—not the white-hot sting of a lie caught, not the black-violet of corruption near. Something quieter. A warmth that started at the hex-plate’s centre and spread outward through the filaments like the first heat of a banked fire finding new fuel. Caelin looked at his arm, surprised. He hadn’t done that. It had.\n\n\"You carry a wound,\" the woman said softly, her hand hovering over the scale without touching, close enough for warmth to pass between them. \"And a key.\"\n\nThornik, already riffling in his pack for a device, froze halfway. \"Oh.\" His voice carried a reverence Caelin hadn't heard from the dwarf before. \"One of the Green. Haven't seen a circle-mark since Grandfather's time.\"\n\n\"The Green?\" Vex's tone suggested she didn't like not knowing things.\n\n\"Druids,\" Thornik said quietly. \"The old kind. The ones who remember what the world was before kingdoms carved it into property lines and tax districts. They're supposed to be extinct—or at least so rare you could spend a lifetime looking and never find one.\"\n\n\"Not extinct,\" the woman said, and something sad colored her voice. \"Just... solitary. The circles broke when the balance did. Most of us walk alone now.\"\n\nShe returned her attention to Caelin's arm, her hand still hovering. The tattoos along her forearms brightened from dull verdant to something closer to true emerald—living light that carried the smell of spring rain and turned earth, clean things, growing things, the opposite of the rot-sweet corruption in the dying forest around them.\n\n\"Names,\" Vex cut in, practical and slightly edged. \"We use them. They keep strangers tidy.\"\n\nThe woman inclined her head, touching two fingers to her sternum then to the nearest dying oak. Under her touch, the bark seemed to ease slightly—the spiral peel settling back into place for a heartbeat before resuming its slow corruption. \"Elowen. Of Sylvaran Grove.\" Her attention returned to the scale. \"Does it burn you?\"\n\n\"Always,\" Caelin said, the truth coming easier after days of the scale punishing evasion.\n\nThe scale snapped a tiny white spark under his skin—irritated sting at the too-simple answer, reminding him it burned worse when he lied or turned from the path, and lately it burned just from existing, just from being what it was: a brand of purpose he couldn't escape.\n\nHe grimaced at the sting.\n\nSomething shifted in Elowen's expression—not pity, but recognition. The look of someone who understood pain that didn't stop. \"May I try to ease it?\"\n\nCaelin hesitated. Another stranger. Another person I'm drawing into whatever waits in those mountains. She should run. They all should. Every step I take toward that sanctum might be leading them to the same fate as those shadow-thralls—corrupted, broken, used as puppets for something that shouldn't breathe.\n\nBut the scale pulsed again, insistent and warm, and he found himself nodding before caution could override the desperate need for relief.\n\n\"Please,\" he said.\n\nElowen lifted her hand, palm hovering an inch above the embedded plate. The tattoos along her arms brightened from dull verdant to true emerald—living light that carried the smell of spring rain and turned earth, loam and new growth and the clean promise of things taking root. She breathed out in a low, rhythmic cadence—older than words, steady as tide against shore.\n\nThe scale cooled.\n\nNot disappeared—it would never disappear, he understood that now with the clarity of permanent things. But the ember-motes drifting inside the obsidian slowed their restless wheel, settling into a gentler tide. The ache that had lived in the filaments since Thornwick—the small, constant hurt he'd learned to ignore because there was no alternative—drew back like a wave retreating from shore.\n\nCaelin's breath caught. He hadn't realized how loud the pain had gotten until it quieted.\n\n\"Light answers light,\" Serana murmured, half-prayer. Her silver-gold divine radiance flickered in response to Elowen's green, two different magics recognizing each other across the space of faith and nature.\n\n\"How—\" Thornik started, his device forgotten in his hands.\n\n\"The mark fights itself,\" Elowen said quietly, her hand still hovering. \"Power and pain tangled together, pulling in different directions. Nature can't heal what was forged—can't undo what dragon-fire branded into flesh—but it can remind the body that rest exists. That pain isn't the only truth.\" Her eyes met Caelin's. \"It won't last long. An hour, maybe two. But it will help.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he managed, the words inadequate for the gift she'd just given—minutes, maybe an hour, without the constant low-grade agony that had become his new baseline. Don't get used to it, he told himself. She won't always be there. Learn to live with the pain, not depend on its absence.\n\nElowen's gaze drifted past him to the flame-path he followed—invisible to her, but she seemed to sense its direction the way animals sense coming storms. \"The pain pulls me the way your fire pulls you,\" she said. \"The forest's agony, the corruption spreading, the Weave tearing—it's all coming from the same wound you're being drawn toward.\" Her expression settled into calm acceptance. \"We follow the same path for different reasons. But we're going to the same place.\"\n\nShe fell into step when they moved on. She didn't ask to join them. Didn't request permission or offer explanation beyond what she'd already said. She simply matched their pace and looked up the trail with the calm of someone who'd been walking toward this for a very long time, knowing it would hurt and going anyway.\n\n\"Tree-hugger,\" Vex muttered under her breath, not quite unkindly. \"Don't get used to her. The forest types always disappear when the fun starts.\"\n\nThe fun, Caelin thought bitterly, feeling the borrowed hour of relief settling into his bones like a temporary reprieve from sentence. Is that what we're calling it?\n\nBut he didn't say it aloud. Just walked, and for the first time since the bonding, his steps didn't quite hurt. The scale pulsed its steady rhythm—softer now, gentler, as if Elowen's magic had convinced it to stop shouting quite so loudly.\n\nThey climbed through the afternoon, and the mountain made them earn every step.\n\nThe trees thinned as altitude stole the soil from under their roots. What remained were twisted pines clinging to rock faces, their needles brown-tipped and dropping, the scent of healthy forest giving way to stone dust and the cold mineral smell of high places where nothing soft survived.\n\nThin air burned his lungs, and the scale’s brief mercy was already fading—the ache creeping back like water through cracks.\n\nThis, he realized, was what the dragon had left him with—pain and questions, a direction without explanation. The others followed because the road existed, not because they believed in him. That was almost worse\n\nThe flame-path brightened as they climbed higher, thin wire hardening to a seam of molten thread that seemed to burn brighter with every switchback. Even Serana cocked her head once and said, \"Do you hear that? Like a hum under the wind.\"\n\n\"I hear it too,\" Thornik confirmed, pulling a tuning fork from his pack. He held it near Caelin's arm and grinned when it thrummed in resonance. \"Harmonic frequency. Gets stronger the closer we get to the source. That's forge-work if I've ever sensed it.\" He tapped his goggles. \"My grandfather would have killed to see readings like this.\"\n\n\"What happens when we reach the source?\" Serana asked, though her tone suggested she wasn't sure she wanted the answer.\n\nThornik's cheer dimmed. \"Depends if it's sleeping or hungry.\"\n\n\"On that note,\" Vex said, already scanning the barren slopes ahead with professional wariness, \"how much does everyone not want to camp on an open ridge under whatever's hunting us?\"\n\nThe sun was dropping toward the western peaks, painting the sky in shades of copper and blood. The temperature was falling with it—fast enough to make their breath visible, fast enough to remind them that mountains killed the unprepared with casual indifference.\n\n\"There,\" Elowen said, pointing to where the trail curved around a shoulder of stone. \"Shelter. Old shelter. Made by those who flew rather than climbed.\"\n\nThey followed her indication and found one of the old drake-cut caves—an arched mouth in the rock, soot-stained from fires gone cold centuries ago. Inside, the ceiling curved in a way no human mason would have chosen, overlapping scales of chisel-work that made Caelin think of ribs and bellies and the inside of a great throat. The air here smelled of old smoke and something sharper—sulfur, maybe, or the ghost of dragon-breath long faded.\n\nDraconic script crooked along one wall in low relief, the lines refusing to sit still unless he looked at them sideways. Meaning teased at the edge of understanding.\n\n\"Please tell me that says 'welcome' and not 'beware all who enter,'\" Thornik muttered, running an appreciative hand along the worked stone.\n\nCaelin squinted until the shapes clicked into sense, the translation rising in his throat like memory. \"'Work done under one sky, so all may breathe,'\" he said softly. \"'Forge heat into law. Keep balance or choke.'\"\n\nThe same message from the crater. The same warning. The same reminder that whatever alliance had forged the Nine, it had been built on necessity, not comfort.\n\n\"Comforting,\" Serana said, though her mouth twitched slightly. \"In its way.\"\n\nThey set a small fire just inside the threshold, using deadfall gathered from the slope below. The smoke carried the sweet-acrid smell of juniper and pine, cutting through the sulfur-stone scent of the cave. Outside, the wind worked itself into a fret along the scree, and night fell fast—the way it does in mountains, swallowing sound and warmth in equal measure.\n\nElowen sat near the entrance where she could see the outline of distant dying trees against the blade of moon. She hummed under her breath now and then—not melody so much as comfort, the kind of sound someone makes when they're holding something broken and trying to keep it still.\n\nWhen Caelin's hand cramped around the cup of thin stew they'd made, when the filaments flared hot with the first real pain since her earlier touch, Elowen shifted closer without comment and let her palm hover near his forearm again.\n\nThe ache eased. Not gone—never gone—but quieter. Manageable.\n\nHe tried to put thanks into a look. She nodded once, understanding without need for words, and returned to her humming.\n\nShe shouldn’t be here, Caelin thought, watching the firelight play across her patient features. None of them should. He wasn’t sure if the mark was leading them somewhere important or just refusing to stop. Either way, they followed, and he let them.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm beneath Elowen's hovering hand, and for a moment—just a moment—the guilt eased along with the pain.",

                "text": "Act II: Shadow at the Fire\n\nVex lay on her side with her back to the wall and one hand under her cheek, the other already resting on a dagger hilt with the casual certainty of someone who'd learned to sleep armed. \"If anyone snores, I smother first and ask forgiveness later,\" she announced to the cave at large.\n\n\"I don't snore,\" Thornik protested, settling his pack as a pillow with careful arrangement of the lumps. \"I strategize audibly. There's a difference.\"\n\n\"Worse,\" Vex said, closing her eyes. \"Murder in slow motion.\"\n\n\"I'll take second watch,\" Serana offered, setting her sword within easy reach and removing only her gauntlets before lying down. She kept her armor on—Caelin noticed she always did, as if expecting attack even in sleep, or perhaps unable to feel safe without the weight of duty pressing on her shoulders.\n\nThornik was already muttering to himself about pressure ratios and gear teeth, his voice dropping to a rhythmic mumble that would have been annoying if it weren't so clearly habitual. The sound of a mind that never quite stopped working, even at rest.\n\nElowen remained near the entrance, humming her not-quite-song, a susurrus that seemed to blend with the wind outside rather than compete with it. Occasionally she would pause, tilt her head as if listening to something only she could hear, then resume the melody.\n\nCaelin banked the small fire and let his head tip back against stone still warm from the day's sun. The embedded plate slipped into its sleep-glow—soft light keeping time with his breath, the ember-motes inside drifting lazy and slow, almost peaceful. For a moment he could almost pretend this was normal. Just travelers sharing a cave, resting before another day's climb.\n\nThen the scale pulsed, reminding him of what he carried, and the illusion shattered.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to sleep, but his mind wouldn't quiet. Every sound outside became a threat. Every shift in the wind became footsteps. The shadow-thralls had found them in Thornwick—what would stop them from finding the group here, trapped in a cave with only one exit?\n\nI've led them into a trap, he thought. One entrance. Stone walls. If something blocks that opening, we're buried alive.\n\nThe scale warmed fractionally but didn't sting. Not quite a lie—just fear circling truth without quite landing on it.\n\nHe listened to the others settling: Vex's breathing evening out into the careful rhythm of someone who slept light but slept nonetheless; Thornik's muttering finally fading to actual snores (though Vex mercifully didn't follow through on her threat); Serana's quiet prayers whispered to a god who might or might not be listening with a single voice anymore; Elowen's humming like a thread connecting them to the forest dying outside.\n\nThe mountain hummed through his bones—a frequency just below hearing, felt rather than heard. He tried to convince himself it was tectonic shift, natural settling, the ordinary sound of stone being stone.\n\nHe failed.\n\nSleep came in fits.\n\n\n\nWhen he woke, there was a man sitting where no man had been.\n\nLong coat. Dark hair pulled back tight. The posture of someone who’d learned to make himself smaller than he was, to take up less space in a room and be forgotten. He wasn’t looking at anyone.\n\n He was looking at Caelin. More specifically, at the embedded scale.\n\nI’m dreaming, Caelin thought, because that was the only explanation that made sense. The fire’s embers pulsed with his heartbeat. The man’s face held the waxy quality of dream-logic, present but not quite real. I’m still asleep. This is fever. This is the scale showing me something.\n\nThe man’s eyes found the plate and didn’t move—ice-blue, pale enough to catch the firelight like mirrors, empty in a way that suggested either perfect calm or perfect absence.\n\nThe fire guttered; shadows wavered strangely across the stone. For an instant Caelin thought the man’s outline darkened where the light should have softened it, but the effect passed as soon as he blinked.\n\nHeat bloomed under Caelin’s sternum—warning, maybe, or simply recognition of another presence that wasn’t natural.\n\nThe man’s hand rested on his knee. His fingers tapped once. Twice. Three times, deliberate as a countdown. Then curled into a fist so tight the knuckles showed white even in dim light. His jaw worked like he was biting down on words that wanted out.\n\nThe fire popped. Nothing moved.\n\nCaelin’s body refused to obey him, every nerve drawn tight beneath his skin. The scale’s heat intensified—not pain but urgent awareness, the same frequency it had hit during the shadow-thrall attack in Thornwick.\n\nA breath caught somewhere to Caelin’s left. Vex had woken without stirring, without even changing the rhythm of her breathing. He felt her awareness like a second set of eyes in the dark. Her dagger hand hadn’t shifted position, but he knew it was ready. Elowen’s humming had stopped; the silence pressed against the cave walls like held breath.\n\nThe stranger’s fingers relaxed again, the motion careful, as if wrestling with a thought he chose not to follow. The air seemed to ease with him.\n\nTime stretched like hot glass between one ember-pop and the next. The man didn’t blink. Then—without transition, without sound, without any sense of departure—he simply wasn’t there anymore. Not stood and walked away. Not faded like mist. Just … gone.\n\nCaelin didn’t know when he slept again. Only that when he startled awake to Serana’s gentle touch for third watch, there was no man by the fire. Just embers dying to ash and his companions sleeping and the cave mouth showing the colorless pre-dawn that comes before the world decides what color it wants to be.\n\nHe sat up, heart hammering hard enough to hurt. The plate jogged with his pulse, light keeping frantic pace. The cave mouth was a slice of grey, and the fire had burned to nothing but warm ash.\n\n“Before you ask,” Vex said without opening her eyes, her voice cutting through the silence like a knife, “yes, I saw him. No, he didn’t make a sound approaching or leaving. Yes, I had a dagger ready the entire time. No, I didn’t throw it because he didn’t move and I wanted to see what he’d do.”  A pause. “You’re welcome.”\n\n“Tracks?” Thornik asked, already halfway to his knees, goggles sliding down over his eyes with a mechanical click.\n\n“None that I can find,” Serana said quietly, brushing the cave floor with a pine branch. “But there’s a mark in the ash where someone sat.” She pointed at a neat oval pressed too deep into the dust. “Boot prints from the entrance to that spot—then nothing. As if he arrived, sat, and simply … stopped.”\n\n“Or the light played tricks,” Vex murmured, finally opening her eyes to fix Caelin with a look that hovered between challenge and curiosity.\n\n“The mountain stopped breathing,” Elowen said, stepping in from the pale dawn with frost in her hair. “Just before sunrise everything went still—the wind, the animals, even the corruption’s spread. Then, slowly, it started again.”\n\n“You felt it too,” Thornik said, not a question. His device clicked softly as he measured the prints. “All five of us aware something happened, none of us certain what.”\n\nCaelin’s hands shook as he accepted the water skin Thornik offered. The scale throbbed dull red now—post-danger ache or punishment for his paralysis, he couldn’t tell.\n\nReal, he thought, mouth dry despite the water. It was real. But what was it? A vision? A warning?\n\nThe thought settled heavy in his gut.\n\n“We need rules,” Serana said, voice firm despite the uncertainty in her eyes. “No one sleeps unwatched. Someone always on guard, always armed. If anything — anything — appears that shouldn’t be there, we wake everyone. Immediately.”\n\n“Agreed,” Vex said, sitting up to check her daggers. “And we need to talk about what we’ll do if he comes back.”\n\n“If he comes back,” Thornik corrected, though his tone suggested the same doubt they all felt. “My instruments didn’t register him. Couldn’t. That shouldn’t be possible.”\n\n“Or it was something between real and not-real,” Elowen said quietly. “Like the corruption’s echo. A reflection finding shape.”\n\nThe scale pulsed once, uneasy but quiet.\n\nThey were finishing a cold breakfast of dried meat and hard cheese—no fire, by unspoken agreement—when the man who might have been a dream walked out of the morning mist and into the cave without asking permission.\n\nHe didn’t posture or bow. He simply crossed the threshold as if invited, took three precise steps, and stopped in the same place he’d occupied by the fire—if he’d been there at all.\n\nMorning light showed hollow cheeks, dark hair pulled back tight, ice-blue eyes that held the emptiness of someone who’d made peace with terrible things—or had them carved out of him.\n\nHe glanced at the sword near Serana’s hand, the axes by Thornik’s knee, Vex’s ready dagger, the careful distance they all kept from the cave’s center. Then he looked at Caelin and said, in a voice like the end of a long argument:\n\n“Durgan.”\n\n“That a name?” Vex asked, blade steady. “Or a noise you make before killing someone?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. He also didn’t smile. His face held the blank neutrality of someone who’d learned that expressions invited questions. In the morning light, his outline looked perfectly ordinary.\n\n“What do you want?” Serana asked, her voice not unkind but not lowering her guard either.\n\nDurgan’s gaze slid past her to the scale in Caelin’s arm again, and for a heartbeat something flickered there — a thought with an edge — acknowledged and set aside with visible effort. His jaw worked. “To follow the path.”\n\n“You can see it?” Thornik asked, suspicious now, goggles whirring as they adjusted focus.\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then how do you know where to go?” Vex’s dagger turned slightly, catching light.\n\n“I’m pulled,” he said, voice flat. “Same as you.” He nodded once toward Caelin, once toward Elowen. “Different hooks. Same rope.”\n\nLiar, Caelin thought, but the scale stayed quiet. Either the man was telling truth, or it couldn’t read whatever darkness lingered around him. Neither option comforted.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Vex said, stepping between them. “He sat in our camp in the middle of the night and vanished, and you want to — what? — let him join us?”\n\n“We don’t know he’s dangerous,” Serana said, though her hand stayed near her sword.\n\n“We don’t know he’s not,” Vex countered. “And I’m not keen on finding out the hard way.”\n\n“If I wanted to hurt you,” Durgan said quietly, “I would have done it last night.”\n\nThe admission hung like smoke. Confirmation that he’d been there. That whatever had happened had touched all of them.\n\n“Not reassuring,” Thornik muttered. “At all.”\n\n“Rules,” Serana said, authority hardening her tone. “If you travel with us, you follow rules. Watch rotation — someone always awake beside you. You don’t approach anyone while they sleep. Understood?”\n\n“No promises on sleep,” Durgan said, voice almost dry. “But I can try.”\n\n“Not good enough,” Caelin said, finding his voice at last. The scale warmed in agreement. “You show up in our camp without sound and expect us to trust you at our backs?”\n\nDurgan met his eyes, calm and unreadable. “No. I expect you to watch me. Keep weapons ready. Assume the worst. But I’m coming either way.” His voice dropped. “The pull’s stronger than I am. Stronger than what’s left of my choice. I can follow you, or walk ahead. Your call.”\n\nThe blunt honesty of it cut through Caelin’s objections. He isn’t asking permission; he’s warning us. At least if he’s with us, we can see him.\n\nThe scale pulsed warm—not approval, but acknowledgment of logic. Sometimes the safest bad choice was the one you could watch.\n\n“Walk with us,” Caelin said at last. “Back of the line. Paired watches—you’re never alone with anyone. Keep your distance unless spoken to. You cross a line, we stop you. Understood?”\n\n“Clear,” Durgan said, and something that might have been relief softened his features. “Thank you.”\n\n“For what?” Vex demanded.\n\n“For treating me honestly.”\n\n“Well,” Thornik said into the silence. “Splendid. Exactly what I hoped for when I left the safety of Deepstone Hold to chase my grandfather’s ghost notes into cursed mountains.”\n\nDespite his words, he shouldered his pack. Despite her glare, Vex didn’t argue further. Because Durgan was right: he was coming whether they wanted him or not. And if the tension in his jaw meant he was fighting something — fatigue, fate, or his own thoughts — then maybe keeping him visible was wiser than wondering where he’d gone.\n\nAt least this way, Caelin thought, they’d see it coming if he broke.The scale warmed once, unreadable as ever.",

                "text": "Act III: Descent into Shadow\n\nThey filed out a little after sunrise, six now instead of five, and Caelin felt the weight of it like physical mass—six lives following the flame-path he alone could see, trusting a dying dragon's prophecy and a mark he'd never wanted. The guilt pressed heavier with each additional soul.\n\nWhen this goes wrong, he thought, watching Durgan take position at the rear without being asked, moving with the careful precision of someone who knew exactly how dangerous he was, —how do I live with that?\n\nThe scale gave no answer. It only pulled, patient and inexorable as tide.\n\nThe mountain had shifted colors while they'd slept. What had been blue-grey slate was now rust-red iron oxide and black basalt, the stone itself changing composition as they climbed higher. The sky looked closer here, pressing down, and the air smelled of ozone—not quite lightning but something similar, the electric taste of power gathering.\n\nThe flame-path tugged harder now, a steady pull on Caelin's nerves that was almost physical. The scale brightened in response, the ember-motes gathering like small birds startled into flight. His sleeve had given up any pretense of covering it—the fabric scorched if held against the plate too long, and he'd stopped trying. Let them see it. Let the world know what he carried.\n\nElowen walked just left of him, her eyes on the distant dying tree line, one hand occasionally hovering near his forearm when the filaments flared hot. Each time she did, the pain eased—not gone, never gone, but quieter. Manageable. She never asked permission. Never made it seem like charity. Just offered relief the way you might offer water to someone thirsty, simple and necessary and temporary.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said once more, low, not trusting himself with more words.\n\nShe dipped her head, understanding without need for words. No platitudes. No false comfort. Just acknowledgment that sometimes small mercies were all the world offered, and you took them when you could.\n\nHe watched the tiny flowers on her circlet open and close with her breath. For a moment, the sight eased the ache in his arm and the noise in his head. She made the world seem survivable again.\n\nThe path narrowed as they climbed, forcing them into single file along a ridge with air on both sides. Caelin led, followed by Vex—close enough to whisper warnings but far enough to react if he stumbled. Then Elowen, moving with the sure-footedness of someone who'd spent a lifetime in wild places. Thornik came next, his pack clicking and whirring with each step, devices registering readings that made him mutter under his breath. Serana held the center-rear position, armored and watchful. And Durgan brought up the back, moving in silence so complete it was almost worse than sound.\n\nCaelin kept glancing back more often than sense demanded, making sure Durgan was still with them. The man’s ice-blue eyes tracked the scale sometimes, studying it in a way that made Caelin’s skin tighten—focused, analytical, unreadable.\n\nThe light behind them shifted on the trail; for an instant Durgan’s outline looked heavier, darker against the stone, then the clouds moved and it was gone. Probably the sun, Caelin told himself, but he still looked again.\n\n\"Stop watching him,\" Vex murmured from behind. \"You'll make yourself paranoid.\"\n\n\"I'm already paranoid.\"\n\n\"Then you'll make yourself more paranoid, which helps no one.\" But her hand never strayed far from her daggers. She was watching too, just more subtly.\n\nThey made the ridge by late afternoon. The wind here smelled of snow and distance, carrying scents from far below—woodsmoke from some distant settlement, the green-rot of dying forests, and underneath it all, a trace of sulfur that made Caelin think of the dragon's crater. Of transformation and ending and beginnings written in glass.\n\nBelow them, carved into the mountain's face, the entrance to something larger than a lair opened its throat.\n\nThe First Sanctum yawned dark and patient, a hundred-foot arch carved by claw and magic alike—dragon architecture built to outlast empires.\n\nDraconic script traced the cliff face in long strokes—fifty feet high, each character big enough to hold a man. The words shimmered slightly, catching light that wasn't quite there, and even from this distance Caelin felt meaning pressing against his mind like a hand against glass.\n\nHe squinted, and the translation rose unbidden:\n\n\"Work done under one sky,\" he murmured, reading the largest characters, \"so all may breathe.\"\n\n\"And choke if we don't,\" Thornik added quietly, shading his eyes with one square hand as he studied the entrance. \"Balance maintained or all falls. That's the bargain, written plain as day in letters tall as towers. Can't say we weren't warned.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed harder in Caelin's arm—recognition, anticipation, something that might have been eagerness or dread or both. The flame-path led straight through that massive opening, disappearing into darkness that seemed to drink the afternoon light.\n\n\"Well then,\" Thornik said after a long silence. \"Shall we try not to die?\"\n\n\"That's always been Plan A,\" Vex said, though her voice held less confidence than her words.\n\nSerana looked at each of them in turn—evaluating, measuring, finding whatever she needed to see. Caelin watched her gaze linger on Durgan, assessment clear in her eyes, before returning to the group as a whole. \"We go together,\" she said. \"And we come out the same way.\"\n\nCaelin hoped she was right, the scale under his skin stayed silent.\n\nDurgan said nothing. His stance was rigid, shoulders drawn, jaw tight. His hands flexed and stilled as if working through pain or focus.\n\nHow long can he keep that control? Caelin wondered. How long before the pull driving all of them becomes something none of them can ignore?\n\nThe flame-path brightened as they began their descent toward the sanctum, as if eager to lead them inside. The scale's pulse quickened, ember-motes swirling faster, and Caelin felt heat building in his chest—not pain yet, but readiness. The Dragon's Ember stirring, preparing for what waited ahead.\n\nThe path down was treacherous—loose scree and switchbacks carved into stone that had been weathered by centuries of storms. Twice, rocks gave way under Thornik's weight, sending him sliding until Serana caught his pack. Once, Vex's foot slipped on ice-slick stone, and only Elowen's quick grab of her cloak kept her from pitching over the edge.\n\nThey helped each other. Warned each other of loose stones and hidden ice. Moved as a unit despite their differences, despite their doubts, despite the fact that half of them had met less than a day ago.\n\nThis is what she meant, Caelin realized, thinking of Vharisax's words about finding others who must bear the Nine. Not just people with power. People who'll catch each other when the mountain tries to kill them. People who'll watch each other's backs even when they're not sure they should trust what's at their own.\n\nThe thought should have been comforting. Instead it made the guilt worse.\n\nThey reached the valley floor as the sun touched the western peaks, painting everything in shades of copper and blood. The sanctum entrance loomed above them now—close enough to see the details in the carving, the precision in every chisel mark, the way the stone had been shaped not just cut but convinced to take this form.\n\nMore Draconic script covered the archway itself, smaller but no less meaningful. Caelin read without thinking:\n\n\"Below: the heart of fire. Above: the watching stars. Between: those who dared forge law from chaos.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Vex muttered. \"Really sells the 'you probably won't die horribly' angle.\"\n\nThornik's devices had gone from clicking to a steady, resonant hum that Caelin felt in his bones. \"The readings here are... extraordinary. Residual magic so dense it's practically solid. This place hasn't been dormant—it's been waiting. And something recently told it to stop waiting.\"\n\n\"The dragon's death,\" Serana said. \"When she passed the scale to Caelin, when the bonding completed—it must have activated something. Sent a signal to sanctums like this across the realm.\"\n\n\"Meaning they're all waking,\" Elowen said quietly, her hand on a patch of moss growing near the entrance—one of the few living things this high up. She closed her eyes, communing with it in ways Caelin didn't understand. \"The forest feels it. The corruption spreading isn't random—it's directed. Purposeful. The sanctums wake, and with them, whatever was sealed beneath.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed black-violet—brief but unmistakable. Corruption warning. Not immediate, but close. Growing.\n\n\"There's something inside,\" Caelin said, the certainty settling cold in his stomach. \"Waiting for us. The shadow-thralls in Thornwick—they were scouts. Lures. Whatever sent them knows we're coming.\"\n\n\"Then we'd best not disappoint it,\" Thornik said, though his cheer sounded forced. He unslung his axes, checking edges that were already sharp. \"Been wanting to test these against proper ancient evil. Academic curiosity and all that.\"\n\n\"You're insane,\" Vex said.\n\n\"Runs in the family.\" But Thornik's hands were steady on his weapons.\n\nSerana drew her sword, silver-gold light running down the blade. “We stay together. No one goes ahead. No one falls behind. If we encounter hostiles, we fight as a unit.” Her gaze landed on Durgan. “If anything feels wrong—if you lose control—we stop you. Clear?”\n\n“Clear,” Durgan said, drawing a long knife scarred from use, the hilt stained dark with age. “If I lose myself, do what you have to.”\n\nThe calm acceptance in his tone made Caelin uneasy.\n\nThey stood at the threshold together, six people bound by oath and necessity and the terrible gravity of prophecy. The sanctum's darkness waited, patient as stone, deep as time. The flame-path led through it, bright and insistent and impossible to ignore.\n\nSomewhere inside, a sound lifted—so low Caelin felt it in his ribs rather than heard it with his ears. Not a voice, not yet. Just a pulse. Waiting.\n\nA heartbeat. Stone grinding stone. The rhythm of something vast and patient, stirring in depths no light had touched in centuries.\n\n\"This is it,\" Caelin said quietly, as much to himself as to the others. \"Whatever the dragon sent me to find. Whatever's been pulling me since Thornwick. It's down there.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed in agreement, ember-motes gathering, light intensifying.\n\n\"Then let's find it,\" Vex said. \"Before my common sense catches up with my curiosity.\"\n\nElowen's hand hovered near Caelin's arm one more time, and the pain eased—last mercy before descent, last moment of relief before they stepped into darkness that might not spit them back out.\n\n\"May the Green guide your steps,\" she said softly. \"May roots find purchase even in stone.\"\n\n\"May the Silver Dawn light our path,\" Serana added, her prayer formal but sincere. \"And hold back the shadows that hunger.\"\n\n\"May the forges remember,\" Thornik said, touching his beard with one hand in what might have been ancestral blessing. \"And may we be worthy of the heat.\"\n\nVex just checked her daggers and said nothing, but the gesture was prayer enough.\n\nDurgan stood at the back, silent, outlined against the shifting light. For a moment the shadows around him wavered with the torch-flame, and Caelin looked away first.\n\nCaelin took the first step into darkness.\n\nThe scale flared bright—prismatic light painting the walls, revealing carved reliefs of dragons and dwarves working side by side, of nine pedestals arranged in sacred geometry, of power shaped into form and form sealed into purpose.\n\nThe flame-path stretched ahead, bright as daylight in the dark, leading down.\n\nThey followed.\n\nThe sanctum swallowed them whole—six people descending into depths where the world's first bargains had been struck, where balance had been forged from chaos, where something sealed beneath stone had been patiently waiting to wake.\n\nThe mountain’s pulse grew louder with every step, stone remembering how to breathe.\n\nBehind them, the entrance shrank to a point of daylight, then vanished around a curve.\n\nAhead, only darkness and the flame-path and the grinding pulse of stone remembering how to breathe.",

                "text": "ACT I: MORNING DEPARTURE\n\nThey left what passed for the last trees just after dawn, where brush gave up pretending it could live and stone took over. The air thinned and sharpened; the wind came clean off snow. Packs shifted on shoulders.\n\n\"Distribution,\" Thornik announced, already elbow-deep in everyone's straps. \"We die evenly, or not at all.\" He shifted rope to Serana, water to Caelin, tools to himself. \"Climbers carry line, churners carry weight, thinkers carry hope.\"\n\n\"Which am I?\" Vex asked, palming a wire coil into her cloak.\n\n\"An outlier,\" he said cheerfully. \"And therefore essential.\"\n\nSerana took her share without complaint, leather creaking as she settled buckles. Durgan shouldered nothing obvious and still moved like a man who'd learned the weight of steel the hard way.\n\nVex's eyes tracked the motion, a cat gauging another predator. \"You sure he's pulling his weight?\"\n\n\"Leave him be,\" Serana said, not looking back. \"We'll see what he carries when it matters.\"\n\nCaelin bent to swing his pack and a nerve of fire pulled taut from his palm to his shoulder. The filaments under his skin went rigid; heat bled into the muscle. His breath caught, jaw tightening against the gasp trying to escape.\n\n\"Here,\" Elowen said, already there, fingers gentle on shoulder strap and sternal buckle. She re-threaded, anchored weight away from the right forearm, breathed once, close enough that the scent of crushed pine needles rode the cold.\n\nCaelin flinched—just a fraction, instinctive—before forcing himself still. The ache loosened by a fraction.\n\n\"Rest isn't surrender,\" she added, barely above wind.\n\nHe nodded, embarrassed by the relief, embarrassed by the flinch, embarrassed by needing help at all.\n\nBelow them, the valley lay shrunken and ghost-pale, a scatter of glass bones where Thornwick had burned. Clouds pressed low, turning the horizon into slate. For a moment, Caelin almost wished the climb could end there—suspended between ruin and whatever waited above.\n\nThey took the slope in diagonals. By midmorning the sun was a thin coin, bright but without warmth. The mountain's breath came steady and cold, smelling of old iron and thawed bone.\n\nOn the third switchback the trail slipped into scree that hissed downhill. Thornik yelped; Serana hauled him back by the collar. Caelin dropped to a knee as the hum he'd felt since Thornwick climbed a note; for two breaths the slab under them held—roots of a scrub pine clenched stone as if remembering how—then let go gently, enough to recover footing.\n\nBehind him, Durgan hadn’t stumbled at all. He stood motionless on the sliding scree, balanced with the ease of someone who knew exactly how much weight to trust each stone with. His shadow pooled at his feet and then—just for a moment, just at the edge of Caelin’s vision—stretched a half-step sideways from where the light said it should be. Then the stone shifted again and the moment passed, and Durgan was simply a man standing on a mountain.\n\nCaelin's plate tightened—faster pulses, not brighter light—and when it eased the ache came back deeper, settling into bone.\n\n\"Key of D,\" Thornik said, as if the near-fall were a footnote. He held a tuning fork near Caelin's arm; it thrummed. \"Closer to E-flat by the teeth. Oh hello, modulation.\"\n\nVex rolled her eyes. \"If the mountain starts singing harmony, I'm going home.\"\n\nNo one believed her.\n\nSerana lingered a moment longer, gaze drifting down the slope where their footprints already blurred in loose grit. \"The higher we climb, the more the air forgets we belong to it,\" she murmured. It wasn't addressed to anyone. \"If the gods meant us for this, they'd have given us thicker lungs.\"\n\nThornik chuckled, misreading her tone. \"That's why we have rope. Rope's a kind of faith.\"\n\nSerana gave him a thin smile that didn't reach her eyes. \"Faith frays.\" Then she turned and started climbing again.\n\nThe flame-path in Caelin's vision had gone from fine hair to taut filament, tugging north and up like a hand on a hook. The others heard it as a hum under wind—the way a kettle sings before it boils.\n\nHe stopped trying to drag his sleeve down. The last linen had singed his skin where it crossed the inlay. The mark would be seen or it would burn him for the privilege of pretending.\n\nDurgan moved behind him, silent as falling ash. \"The pull's stronger,\" he said. Caelin glanced back. Durgan's eyes stayed on the ridge ahead, unreadable.\n\nIt wasn't shame that made him hide it now, just the wish to look ordinary for one more heartbeat before the next mountain took it away.\n\nThey climbed, and the hum followed—steady, rising, like breath drawn before a word. The flame-path kinked sharply ahead at the ridge, insisting on a particular route. Caelin squinted through thin air and made out where the path narrowed between two wind-carved pillars. Something was already there. He could see the outline of it—someone standing where there had been no one a moment before.",

Violets for eyes, not color so much as focus: not where you were, but where you looked from. Her clothes were court-sin applied to travel: layered, impractical, and somehow no worse for the walk. She carried almost nothing and yet the air around her moved on a slightly different beat, like a ripple behind the rhythm.\n\n\"I've been tracking something hot all morning,\" she said, and let her gaze travel—very deliberately—from the obsidian plate pulsing in Caelin's forearm to his mouth.\n\nThornik fumbled his striker. tink—tink—tink. \"That's a pressure fuse—\" he squeaked, and dove to catch it.\n\nVex slid her eyes past Caelin. \"Let me guess—another follower of the... whatever we're following.\"\n\n\"Something like that, darling,\" the woman purred.\n\n\"Don't call me darling,\" Vex said, already bored.\n\n\"Call me Nyx—everyone does when they want something,\" the woman said, smiling. \"Or Nyxara if you're feeling ceremonious.\"\n\n\"I'll stick with Nix,\" Vex said. \"Short for no.\"\n\n\"Mmm. Most men beg to make it yes by the end.\"\n\n\"Lucky I'm not most men.\"\n\nSerana's scowl could have salted meat. Her hand drifted to her hilt by reflex. Elowen passed without pausing, humming the tune she used to keep herself steady. Durgan didn't look at Nyxara at all; he looked past her—as if measuring the ledge for exits.\n\nThe plate in Caelin's arm lifted a faint silver shimmer—magic near magic, attention not threat. No black-violet bloom. Just the world noticing.\n\nThornik’s device clicked twice—the particular pattern it made when registering magic it hadn’t catalogued before. “Warlock,” he said quietly, more to himself than anyone. “Bound talent. She’s drawing from something old. Something that made a bargain before she was born.”\n\n\"Patrons grow restless when old covenants stir,\" Nyxara said lightly. \"Nine arts, nine lights—such pretty math. I follow the sums.\"\n\n\"We're not hiring,\" Vex told her.\n\n\"Good,\" Nyxara said. \"I'm terribly expensive.\"\n\nThornik had his striker back in its pouch. \"Do patrons always rehearse entrances, or is that just—\" He stopped himself before saying something he'd regret. \"Nyxara,\" he corrected briskly.\n\nNyxara's smile didn't change, but the air cooled by a degree.\n\n\"Entrances are for the audience.\" She nodded at the arch. \"The mountain has excellent taste.\"\n\nCaelin weighed the two options: a knife at their backs or one where he could see the blade. The scale kept a tightened pulse—not warning, not ease.\n\nHe thought about Durgan's words from days ago: I can walk with you, or I can follow you. If I follow, you won't know where I am when you sleep.\n\nThe logic was the same here.\n\n\"Walk with us,\" he said, keeping his voice neutral. \"It's a long way to fall alone.\"\n\nThe threat was there, unspoken but clear. Nyxara heard it and her smile widened—not offended, amused.\n\n\"Safer for everyone,\" he added.\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Vex murmured. \"A complication with cheekbones.\"\n\nSerana set the terms, flat and formal. \"Distance at night. Truth by day.\"\n\n\"Daylight forgives many sins,\" Nyxara said, stepping off the prettiest light to prove she could. \"I accept.\"\n\nThey filed past along the narrow path. Nyxara fell in two places back from Caelin, exactly where her perfume could find him and his eyes could find her. Durgan drifted to the tail without being told. He turned an empty palm up to the sun for a heartbeat, as if testing heat or habit, then closed it again. His shadow lay tidy at his feet.\n\nCaelin didn't relax. The plate stayed warm. The mountain waited.",

Lichens went the wrong colors—bruised blue, sour yellow—on rocks that should have held only iron stains. Pines shed needles like summer was a month too old. The air tasted faintly of ozone, then stronger.\n\n\"Key of E-flat, and rising,\" Thornik said, happy and worried in the same breath. \"That's forge-work waking.\"\n\nOn a narrow traverse, Nyxara brushed close to Vex. \"I do prefer a precarious position.\"\n\n\"Trip,\" Vex said, without looking, \"and I'll help. Down.\"\n\nThornik tried not to listen and nearly stepped off the world. Serana caught his pack strap with two fingers and hauled him straight without comment.\n\nBy noon, Caelin's pain had climbed beside him. The filaments hummed like insects under his skin. When he snapped \"I'm fine\" at Thornik's third concerned glance, the scale snapped white at the lie.\n\nA flicker of fear crossed his face before he could hide it—fear of the scale, fear of the pain, fear of what it meant that even small lies cost him now.\n\nElowen's palm hovered, and the ache drew back—but faded faster than it had that morning. The cooling lasted minutes, not the hour it had given before. She met his eyes once: not forever.\n\nHe nodded, ashamed that he'd needed it again, ashamed that it was already fading, ashamed that he resented her for the limits of what she could give.\n\nVex noticed Nyxara noticing Elowen's noticing. She filed it with the same neatness she filed other things that turned into leverage later.\n\nSerana's prayer under her breath answered in a flick of gold light that drained to cold silver before returning to nothing. She set her jaw and kept the pace. Durgan never came closer than three paces to anyone's spine. Always in sight. Never in reach.\n\nThey topped a shoulder and saw it for the first time: far above, a dark seam in the cliff face, too clean for weather, too large for any lair a sane world would house. Caelin felt meaning rise from it as if someone had pressed a hand against glass—his mind the other side.\n\n\"Later,\" he told it, which was a lie of tone rather than fact. The scale let it pass.\n\n\n\nThey found shelter in a drake-cut alcove where wind had polished the arch smooth. Over the entrance, shallow-carved characters lay like old ribs. Caelin cocked his head until the meaning clicked.\n\n\"Speak true or speak not at all,\" he translated.\n\n\"Not a compulsion, then,\" Vex said. \"A dare.\"\n\nThornik coaxed a sullen fire with his striker, which pop-banged once before deciding to behave. \"Controlled pop,\" he said, eyebrows a little shorter.\n\nHe rummaged in his pack, produced a dented kettle with far too many hinges, and perched it over the flame. The contraption wheezed, whined, and finally surrendered a thread of steam.\n\n\"Family recipe,\" he declared, pouring a swallow of something that smelled like boiled tar. \"Miners swore by it. Or swore at it. My uncle drank it daily and lived to seventy, which is either proof of its medicinal value or the reason he collapsed under a tunnel. Hard to say. Anyway—tea.\"\n\nThey sat in a loose circle. Nyxara chose a spot naturally equidistant from Caelin and Durgan, like a needle between magnets. Serana's gaze moved over their faces and found enough resolve to speak like a commander.\n\n\"If we're to risk dying together,\" she said, \"we should know who we're dying beside.\"\n\nThe Shares\n\nThornik began like a flood and ended like a dam. \"Clan chased dragon-forges. Granddad bled his journals into maps no one believed. I'm here to prove he wasn't mad.\"\n\nHe looked surprised at the neatness of his own summary.\n\n\"Look at that,\" Vex said. \"Brevity. It suits you.\"\n\nThe scale held a steady coal-glow through Thornik's words. Enthusiasm, yes. Lies, no.\n\nSerana clasped her gauntlets in her lap. \"I swore the Oath of Dawn. To protect the living. To preserve the balance. To stand where others fall.\"\n\nHer gaze flicked toward Caelin's forearm, then dropped back into ritual cadence.\n\n\"Since Thornwick, the counsel at my altars has... conflicted.\" A pause that cost. \"I haven't known silence since I was twelve. Now I can't tell which voice to obey.\"\n\nThe scale answered with gold light—then flared a white spark when she stepped around something, a failure or a choice she didn't name.\n\n\"Better practiced than unmeant,\" she said to Vex's arched brow, and looked back into the fire.\n\nNyxara's gaze flicked toward her, soft with something that might have been pity or calculation; it was hard to tell which.\n\nDurgan stared into the coals like they were a road. \"Soldier. Empire fell. Traveled. Now here.\"\n\n\"Empire,\" Thornik said carefully. \"Which one?\"\n\nDurgan didn't answer. For a split second his eyes unfocused, seeing something that wasn't the fire. His hand, resting on his knee, clenched into a fist so tight the knuckles went white.\n\nThen it passed. He uncurled his fingers deliberately, one at a time.\n\nThe shadow at his feet rippled a fraction off the fire's logic and settled.\n\nCaelin thought he saw the plate go darker—not black-violet, not the Seal's bruise, just a momentary deepening—and then it was gone, like a breath refused.\n\nVex's mouth twitched but she said nothing, knife spinning lazy circles between her fingers. Mysterious isn't the same as interesting, her expression said, but she kept it to herself.\n\nNyxara watched Durgan as if he were a riddle she'd enjoyed before and meant to enjoy again.\n\nElowen folded her hands. \"I studied endings until my circle called it wrong. Rot feeds growth. The forest hurts. I go where it hurts.\"\n\nHer tattoos pulsed a soft, truer green in the saying; the mountain seemed to breathe easier for a heartbeat.\n\nThe scale warmed gently—no sting, no show.\n\nSerana's eyes lowered, not in reverence but envy of that simple, certain faith.\n\nVex stared at her own dagger point, turning it between thumb and finger. \"Pass,\" she said. \"My business is mine.\"\n\n\"We know you're here for answers about your mother,\" Caelin said quietly.\n\nSomething sharpened behind Vex's mismatched eyes. \"Fine. She hunted the Concord. The Peaks took her or hid her. Her notes point here. I mean to find the rest.\"\n\nShe stopped cleanly, like a blade finding a sheath.\n\nThe scale snapped white.\n\nShe glanced at it and didn't flinch. Caelin held her gaze for a beat longer, a silent question passing between them. Why lie when we all know the truth?\n\nShe held his stare, unflinching. Because it's mine to carry.\n\nHe nodded once and moved on.\n\n\"Your jewelry doesn't like that answer,\" he said neutrally.\n\n\"My jewelry is knives,\" she said, and smiled without humor.\n\nNyxara tipped her head toward the lintel's warning—Speak true or speak not at all—as if accepting a dare.\n\n\"Courts hire the curious,\" she said, words like lace running over wire. \"Patrons cherish them. I collect secrets no one else can keep. Nine arts, nine lights; I favor the ones that bend.\"\n\nShe lifted her gaze to Caelin. \"Where will breaks, the soul breaks with it. That's where I walk.\"\n\nThe scale began to spark—restless, trying to pin her down and failing. Too smooth; too well-dressed. Truths thread through lies thread through truths until the weave refused to sit still.\n\n\"Which patron?\" Serana asked, voice flat.\n\n\"The kind that appreciates discretion,\" Nyxara said sweetly. \"You'd enjoy him the least.\"\n\nVex snorted. \"At least you're entertaining. Don't stab us in the back and we'll get along.\"\n\n\"I never stab,\" Nyxara said, and let a smile finish the sentence for her.\n\nAt last the circle turned the other way.\n\nCaelin had known this moment would arrive all day; dread still found a way to surprise him.\n\n\"Exiled for visions,\" he said. \"Wandered. Thornwick by—\"\n\nThe scale flared white-hot, cutting him off. He grimaced, jaw tight against the pain. \"Not chance. The dragon called me. The Ember chose me.\"\n\nHe bared his forearm to the fire—hex plate lying flush with skin, hair-fine filaments lacing to the elbow. The ember-motes inside the obsidian drifted like slow stars.\n\n\"I didn't ask for this,\" he said, low. \"But it won't let me walk away.\"\n\nThornik leaned forward, goggles twitching as if they wanted to be part of the conversation. Elowen did not stare; she had already decided the mark was a wound, not a wonder. Durgan catalogued angles—entry, exit, where a blade would need to land to sever tendon without killing.\n\nCaelin tried not to see it.\n\n\"Truth by day,\" Serana said softly, and let the subject rest.\n\nFor a moment none of them moved, each trapped in their own reflection of the firelight: six faces, six burdens, one lie each refusing to surface.\n\nThe wind found the mouth of the alcove, humming low through the carved warning above them.\n\nIt wasn't a voice, not yet.\n\nBut it sounded like one learning the shape of their names.",

The air grew thicker, harder to pull into lungs that had forgotten what sea-level felt like.\n\n\"Higher we go, the more the world decides we're guests,\" Thornik muttered, adjusting his pack straps for the third time in an hour.\n\n\"Unwelcome ones,\" Vex added.\n\nFar ahead, the path bent out of sight—light thinning, sound thickening.\n\nThe air changed—metallic on the tongue, like a coin held too long.\n\nDust lifted off the floor in a slow breath that belonged to nothing living.\n\nSerana's wardlight thinned to a bruised milk color, then steadied. She frowned, adjusting her grip on the hilt at her side.\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words, nothing more.\n\nCaelin felt the scale tighten under his skin—warning without pain, just a steady pressure that said pay attention.\n\nThey rounded a bend where the lantern halo met shadow.\n\nAt first it was just darkness pooling where it shouldn't—a trick of the stone, a hollow catching less light. Then it moved.\n\nShadow rose before the wall could cast it—slick, jointed, learning how to stand.\n\nWhen it spoke, three voices braided together: the person it had been, something ancient and patient, and beneath both a sound like stone grinding on stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" it said. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\n\"Company,\" Vex murmured—already moving, already small, body language shifting from traveler to predator in a heartbeat.\n\n\"Hold,\" Serana said, her tone a blade laid flat.\n\nThornik didn't look up from his satchel. \"Short fuse, low yield. Nobody breathe wrong.\" His hands moved with practiced speed, assembling something small and precise.\n\nNyxara's smile was silk over wire. \"Do try not to die. I just learned your names.\"\n\nCaelin's scale flared black-violet at the edges—corruption warning, irregular pulse. The thing ahead wasn't just shadow. It was wrong, fundamentally displaced from what should be.\n\nHe drew heat and starved it—no blaze, just a hard, white line along his palm. Focused. Controlled. The kind of fire that cut instead of consumed.\n\nThe scale approved with pain—a sharp spike through the filaments that made his vision narrow for a heartbeat.\n\nHe let the line kiss the rising shadow at what passed for an ankle.\n\nIt shrieked in three registers at once and stumbled—more insult than injury, but it moved. The shadows comprising its form scattered like startled birds, then regathered with visible effort.\n\nSerana lifted her hand and set a ward between the thing and Elowen—a square of clean gold light that held.\n\nFor a heartbeat her jaw clenched, eyes gone distant, as if listening to a voice that couldn't agree with itself. The ward flickered—silver-gold-silver—then stabilized.\n\nIt didn't fail. It shook, then set.\n\nThornik rolled a thimble-sized charge underhand. It coughed instead of boomed—pure percussion, designed for enclosed spaces.\n\nThe tunnel answered with a slap of echo that flattened the shadow's edges, forcing definition where it wanted to remain formless.\n\n\"Acoustic shear,\" he said, delighted even in the midst of danger. \"Knew it would work.\"\n\nVex went low and left, a quick insult of steel that took what counted for a heel. The shadow recoiled from the touch of worked metal, hissing.\n\nNyxara didn't bother to draw a weapon; she spoke a word that bent the angle of the lantern-light. Reality twisted—just slightly—and suddenly light existed where it shouldn't, casting shadows that trapped the thing from three impossible directions.\n\nThe shadow flinched from light that shouldn't have existed there.\n\n\"Transposition,\" she said mildly, as if naming a wine.\n\nThe thing collapsed back into behaving shadow, dragging a cold with it that wasn't temperature so much as absence—the feeling of standing where something warm used to be.\n\nIt said nothing more. It only learned the shape of their fear and thinned into the wall, leaving frost patterns that hadn't been there before.\n\nSilence returned in pieces—first to the floor, then to the air, then, last of all, to their breathing.\n\nCaelin flexed scorched fingers. The scale's ember settled from angry red back to steady coal-glow—account tallied, for now. The pain lingered, a reminder of the cost.\n\nSerana's light guttered and steadied; she didn't move her hand until it stopped shaking. When she lowered it, her palm was pale, fingers trembling almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"Next time we turn back,\" Vex said, wiping steel on her cloak.\n\nNo one agreed. No one disagreed.\n\nDurgan watched the wall where the shadow had gone, eyes unreadable. His own shadow lay perfectly still at his feet, patient as stone.\n\n\"Not a voice,\" Thornik said softly, more to himself than the others. \"Not yet.\"\n\nThey moved on, slower, as if the tunnel might listen for names they hadn't meant to give.",

                "text": "ACT V: THE HOLLOW ROAD\n\nThey walked until silence felt heavier than noise.\n\nThe mountain had gone from predator to cathedral—huge, patient, and indifferent.\n\nEvery sound came back doubled, as if the tunnels were practicing conversation.\n\nLight changed first: fire glow flattening to a copper haze that had no source. The air thickened, dry as powdered bone. Their own heartbeats became percussion.\n\nSerana's wardlight threw their shadows forward in tall, twitching columns that moved just slightly out of sync with their steps.\n\nVex stopped once, hand on wall. \"There's warmth under the stone,\" she said.\n\n\"Residual energy,\" Thornik answered, consulting a brass thermometer from his pack. \"Or a warning.\"\n\n\"Feels like both,\" Elowen murmured, her fingers resting against the basalt. The green of her tattoos pulsed faintly, then dimmed.\n\nThe passage ended in a smooth half-circle of carved basalt.\n\nAcross it, nine sigils burned faintly—shapes that refused the eye, looping back on themselves like reflections in a warped mirror. They seemed to shift when looked at directly, settling only when viewed peripherally.\n\nCaelin's plate flared in response, ember light threading through his forearm in sympathetic rhythm—bright warm pulse of recognition.\n\n\"Same count,\" Thornik whispered, voice hushed with awe. \"Nine arts, nine lights.\"\n\nNyxara reached toward the nearest sigil; the air hissed like cooling iron.\n\n\"Touch nothing,\" Serana said, sharper than she meant to. Her hand had moved to her sword hilt by reflex.\n\nCaelin felt words form in his mouth unbidden—language without thought, pulled from the scale's memory rather than his own.\n\n\"Work done under one sky...\"\n\nThe glyph nearest him brightened, then went still.\n\n\"...so all may breathe.\"\n\nThe hum in the floor deepened; stone resonated like a held note. The other sigils pulsed in sequence, one after another, acknowledging the words.\n\nNot a trap. Not quite permission either.\n\nSomething in between—recognition.\n\nThornik crouched, goggles gleaming in the sigil-light. \"Pressure wards tied to tonal frequency—song as lock. Brilliant. Grandfather mentioned these but I thought—\"\n\n\"Meaning you can open it?\" Vex interrupted.\n\n\"Meaning it might open us instead,\" he said cheerfully.\n\nNyxara's lips curved. \"Some doors require confession. Others, blood.\"\n\nSerana shot her a look. \"We'll start with faith and see where it fails.\"\n\nThe scale pulsed once—red to gold to violet—cycling through colors like breathing. For a breath the world went quiet inside Caelin, the constant ache fading to nothing.\n\nHe saw the sigils as living veins, the mountain's pulse running slow beneath his feet. Connections spreading out like roots or arteries, feeding something vast and sleeping.\n\nThen it passed, leaving a metallic taste behind his teeth and the ache returning sharper than before.\n\n\"Something knows we're here,\" he said.\n\n\"We made sure of that,\" Durgan replied, eyes on the sigils.\n\nThe first sigil turned liquid, sinking into the stone like water into sand. A seam appeared, exhaling a draft that smelled of dust, smoke, and memory—air that hadn't moved in centuries suddenly set free.\n\nSerana's wardlight flared in answer—reflex, not choice—steady gold for three heartbeats before settling back to her trained discipline.\n\nWhen the glow settled, a corridor sloped downward, lined with facets that caught and bent their torchlight until it shimmered like water over stones.\n\n\"Going in?\" Vex asked. \"Or waiting until it eats someone braver?\"\n\nThornik was already adjusting his pack. \"I vote in. If it eats me, document the process.\"\n\nNyxara smiled. \"I do like an optimist with an expiration date.\"\n\nSerana drew her sword. \"Light first, words after.\"\n\nCaelin stepped forward, because something in the hum expected him to. The flame-path in his vision led straight down that corridor, bright as a wire pulled taut.\n\nThe air inside the new passage moved with a slow, deliberate rhythm—breathing, but not with lungs. Something mechanical, ancient, still keeping time.\n\nBehind them, the sigils dimmed until only one faint ember remained—the one Caelin had spoken to.\n\nThe mountain had accepted their offer, or marked it.\n\nEither way, it had listened.\n\nThey set watches in pairs, because Serana refused not to. The encounter with the shadow-thrall had proven they couldn't afford to be caught unprepared again.\n\nCaelin with Vex, Serana with Thornik, Elowen with Durgan—because someone had to, and because Durgan's earlier warning still sat in everyone's mind: I can walk with you, or I can follow you. If I follow, you won't know where I am when you sleep.\n\nBetter to know.\n\nCaelin and Vex took the first hours. The flame-path was a bright wire across his sight even in dark; it tugged like it had hands, patient and insistent.\n\n\"Your scale went supernova for the warlock,\" Vex said, quiet enough to be courtesy.\n\n\"She's hiding,\" Caelin said. \"So is everyone else.\"\n\n\"You included,\" Vex said. \"You sparked on 'chance.'\"\n\n\"This thing makes lying impossible,\" he said, looking at his forearm where the plate pulsed soft coal-light. \"Even to myself.\"\n\n\"Must be exhausting,\" she said without malice, and they watched the stars try not to freeze.\n\nAfter a while, Vex spoke again, softer. \"She went looking for this. My mother. Same mountains, same ruins, same stupid pull toward things that should stay buried.\"\n\nShe didn't look at him, just kept her eyes on the dark.\n\n\"Her notes stop at 'fire-kept covenants.' Just... stop. Like she found what she was looking for and it erased the need to write anything else.\"\n\n\"Or she couldn't write anymore,\" Caelin said, then wished he hadn't.\n\nVex's jaw tightened. \"Yeah. Or that.\"\n\nThey sat with that truth until their watch ended.\n\nSerana and Thornik took second watch. Serana prayed without sound, lips moving through familiar cadences. Thornik tried not to hum back to the tuning fork's itch in his bones, but occasionally a soft note would escape, harmonizing with the mountain's deep resonance.\n\n\"Do you hear it too?\" he whispered. \"The way the stone... sings?\"\n\n\"I hear my goddess,\" Serana said. \"Or I used to.\"\n\nThornik looked at her, then back at his instruments. \"That's... I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't be. Doubt is a kind of clarity.\"\n\nElowen settled near the mouth with Durgan because someone had to. She watched the outline of dead needles against a blade of winter moon. He didn't move except to breathe. His shadow might have shifted. Or the fire might have guttered. Or both.\n\n\"I saw it,\" Vex whispered from her roll, not quite asleep.\n\n\"Shadows crawl when embers sink,\" Serana said steadily from her watch.\n\n\"Parallax,\" Thornik muttered, caught between sleep and waking. \"Warm air vent. Looks like movement when it isn't.\"\n\n\"There is no wind,\" Elowen said.\n\nNo one spoke after that. The fire sank. So did certainty.\n\nNyxara did not sleep. She sat half-lidded, facing the invisible wire only Caelin could see. The air around her kept that one-beat lag, like a dancer listening to a different drummer. Occasionally her lips would move, shaping words no one else could hear—communing with something that answered in silence.\n\nThe ground thrummed once, deep enough to belong to bones. Stone ground stone somewhere below—one heavy beat like a chain tugged and made to hold. Thornik's kit began to hum to the same pitch, all at once—every metal piece resonating in sympathy.\n\nThe scale throbbed angry red though Caelin had cast no magic, breath catching in his throat as pain spiked without warning.\n\nEveryone who had been asleep woke with weapons to hand. They listened until the mountain went quiet again, which is a different quiet than before something happens.\n\n\"Something knows we're coming,\" Caelin thought, and the thought did not feel like his alone.\n\nThey banked the coals and waited for dawn.",

                "text": "ACT VI: THE LONG NIGHT\n\nThey walked until their torchlight shrank to islands in a black sea.\n\nWhen Thornik called halt, no one argued.\n\nThey chose a chamber where the ceiling arched low and the air at least pretended to stay still—a bubble of relative safety in the mountain's throat.\n\nFire wouldn't take at first; the damp stone ate sparks with patient hunger.\n\nThornik muttered equations until the tinder surrendered, coaxing flame through sheer engineering stubbornness.\n\nVex set her back to a wall and unwrapped dried meat with the deliberation of someone daring it to complain. Each movement precise, controlled—the way she did everything.\n\nNyxara brushed dust from her coat as if dirt were an opinion she disagreed with.\n\nDurgan took no watch post; he simply stood at the chamber's edge, shadow even and patient, eyes reflecting firelight like a cat's.\n\n\"Quality lodgings,\" Vex said, breaking the silence. \"I give it one star—half if something bites me.\"\n\nThornik gestured grandly at the faint fire. \"Central heating included. Indoor plumbing is extra.\"\n\nSerana's smile almost happened, then didn't. The corner of her mouth lifted for half a heartbeat before something pulled it back down.\n\nCaelin caught the half-moment and felt its absence like weather changing—the way you\n\nknow rain is coming before the first drop falls.\n\n\n\nCaelin took first watch. The flame-path in his vision had dimmed to a fine pulse, like a heartbeat under frost—present but muted, patient.\n\nSerana joined him without being asked, sitting a pace away where the light touched both of them but left space between.\n\nFor a while neither spoke. Then Serana's hand moved to her pendant—the sunburst symbol of the Silver Dawn—and her lips shaped words he couldn't hear.\n\n\"Guide me,\" she whispered—habit, not plea.\n\nSilence. Then, faint as breath: two threads twined into one voice.\n\nShield the bearer. Offer the bearer.\n\nHer chalk snapped in her hand.\n\nCaelin turned. \"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" She brushed the dust away, steady but not steady enough. Her fingers trembled as she gathered the broken pieces.\n\nHer wardline brightened and held—a thin circle of gold light around their small camp—but her voice didn't.\n\n\"Rest isn't surrender,\" she said, echoing Elowen's words from earlier, and looked at the fire until the words meant something again.\n\n\"Your goddess,\" Caelin said carefully. \"She's still speaking?\"\n\n\"Two of her are,\" Serana said, so quietly he almost missed it. \"And they can't agree.\"\n\nShe stood then, ending the conversation before it could go deeper. \"Your watch ends in two hours. Wake Thornik.\" Then she moved to her bedroll, lying down with her back to the fire.\n\nBut Caelin saw her hand go to her pendant again. Saw her lips move in prayer.\n\nSaw nothing answer.\n\n\n\nWhen she rose to change shifts, Durgan replaced her without sound.\n\nVex hadn't slept. \"You don't blink much,\" she said from her bedroll, eyes reflecting firelight.\n\n\"Wastes moisture,\" he replied.\n\n\"That supposed to be funny?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe rolled over. \"Good. I'd hate to think you had hobbies.\"\n\nHis shadow stretched toward the fire, then back—just a flicker, barely noticeable. Could have been the flames. Could have been something else.\n\nDurgan's hand went to his nose—checking, the gesture automatic now—but came away clean.\n\nNot yet, he thought. But soon.\n\n\n\nElowen woke at the change in sound; the mountain had exhaled differently. A shift in the air pressure, or perhaps just her nature-sense responding to something the others couldn't feel.\n\nShe found Caelin still by the fire, staring at his hand as if deciding who it belonged to.\n\n\"If it spikes, don't ask me to take it,\" she said softly, settling beside him.\n\nHe blinked. \"You were the one who offered.\"\n\n\"I can carry it,\" she said. \"But it carves me out to do it. Like pouring clean water into a cracked cup and finding the puddle is me.\"\n\nA breath; the faint scent of scorched green rose from her skin and vanished. The blackened edges of her tattoos were more visible now in the firelight—the price of easing his pain accumulating in her flesh.\n\n\"Save me for when you're dying,\" she finished. \"Not for when you're hurting.\"\n\nHe nodded. It wasn't agreement so much as acceptance of debt. Understanding that her gift had limits, that asking too often would break her.\n\n\"How long?\" he asked. \"Before it's too much?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said honestly. \"The forest doesn't count days. It counts seasons. Endings.\" She smiled, sad and small. \"I'll know when I know.\"\n\nThey sat together until her watch came, and she moved to take position at the chamber mouth, humming that tune again—the one that sounded like growing things deciding whether to live or die.\n\n\n\nThornik sat hunched over a sketchbook, coal-smudged and muttering, trying to capture the geometry of the nine sigils before memory faded them.\n\nNyxara watched from across the fire, head tilted with the curiosity of a cat observing a particularly interesting insect.\n\n\"You always measure the world?\" she asked.\n\n\"Only what tries to kill me. Helps with repeat attempts.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"And if it succeeds?\"\n\n\"Then my notes survive.\" He tapped the journal. \"Someone smarter than me can learn from my mistakes.\"\n\n\"Ambitious corpse,\" she said, and turned her gaze to the glowing coals as if reading her own epitaph there.\n\n\"What about you?\" Thornik asked, surprising himself with the boldness. \"Does your patron get your notes when you die?\"\n\n\"My patron gets everything,\" Nyxara said lightly. \"That's rather the point of patronage.\"\n\n\"And you're fine with that?\"\n\n\"I've been fine with it for quite some time now.\" Her smile didn't change, but something in her eyes did—something old and resigned and perhaps a little sad. \"Long enough to know the bargain was worth it. Long enough to know the price hasn't come due yet.\"\n\nThornik wanted to ask more, but something in the way she looked at the fire told him the conversation was over.\n\n\n\nBy the time last watch came, the fire was a red pupil in the dark.\n\nEach of them had taken their turn at silence and found it too loud.\n\nSerana's wardline ringed the camp in a thin, wavering halo; now and then it flickered like breath caught mid-prayer. Each flicker lasted longer than the last.\n\nThe hum returned—deep, bone-slow, curious.\n\nIt moved through the stone beneath them and counted heartbeats.\n\nSeven.\n\nSeven hearts beating in the dark. Seven souls climbing toward something that watched and waited and remembered when the world was younger.\n\nWhen it passed, the silence it left behind didn't feel empty.\n\nIt felt patient.\n\nCaelin lay in his bedroll, eyes open, watching the shadows dance on the ceiling. The scale pulsed in time with his heart—soft coal-glow, steady and eternal.\n\nSomething knows we're coming, he thought again.\n\nAnd this time, the thought came with a response—not words, not quite, but a presence acknowledging him. Recognizing him.\n\nWaiting for him.\n\nFar below, deeper than any tunnel they'd yet walked, something shifted. A chain pulled taut, tested its links, and held.\n\nAnd in the perfect darkness of that deep place, something counted.\n\nThud.\n\nThe sound was too deep for ears, felt in bone and blood.\n\nThud.\n\nSeven hearts beating above.\n\nOne heart—if it could be called a heart—beating below.\n\nThud.\n\nCaelin's hand went to his forearm, pressing against the embedded plate as if he could stop what was coming by holding it still.\n\nThe scale pulsed back at him—not warning, not comfort.\n\nJust recognition.\n\nYou're expected, it seemed to say.\n\nHe closed his eyes and tried to sleep, knowing he wouldn't.\n\nThe mountain breathed around them. Patient. Eternal.\n\nListening.\n\n\n\nEND CHAPTER 4\n\n\n\nWord Count: ~13,800 words",

Caelin woke to Vex's palm over his mouth, her other hand clamped to his shoulder.\n\n\"Don't make a sound,\" she breathed. \"Company.\"\n\nThe scale in his right forearm tightened its pulse, not warning, not ease—just braced. Coal-glow slid toward ember-red; the fine obsidian filaments beneath his skin crawled up toward the elbow like roots searching stone.\n\nFrom the lower passage—the one they'd marked with chalk and left closed—voices braided the air. Wrong, guttural, harmonized like things that had practiced speaking together inside the same throat.\n\n\"Ember-born...\"\n\n\"...the chain calls...\"\n\n\"...submit or be consumed...\"\n\nVex's hand left his mouth. \"Up,\" she hissed, and the camp came alive in a soft clatter of straps and breath.\n\nSerana rolled to her feet, sword in one hand, the other kindling silver-gold. The light stuttered gold→silver→gold—a tremor she smoothed with breath. Thornik's pack went from hum to urgent whine as needles spun. Elowen's vine-marks dimmed to a determined green. Nyxara stood in a movement that wasn't one, purple aura guttering like a candle in wind. Durgan took the choke point, blades bare, shadow pooled neat at his boots—too neat.\n\n\"Signatures?\" Vex murmured.\n\nThornik checked a gauge that vibrated his teeth. \"Multiple. Same resonance as Thornwick—stronger. Focused.\"\n\n\"They'll smell the Ember,\" Nyxara said, eyes on Caelin's arm. \"A bonfire in a dark valley.\"\n\n\"Can you dim it?\" Serana asked, already moving to shield the center.\n\n\"No.\" He'd tried. White sparks punished lies, and it punished denial just as fast.\n\n\"Then we work with it,\" Serana said. \"Caelin center-back. I hold the line. Thornik on my flank, steel first, toys second. Vex wide right. Elowen disrupt their approach. Nyxara—\"\n\n\"I'll... persuade,\" Nyxara murmured, voice a soft knife.\n\nDurgan didn't wait for orders. \"They know exactly where we are,\" he said, jaw tight. \"Kill fast, before the trap closes.\"\n\nThe voices fell silent. The air drew a breath.\n\nBy first light that never reached this deep, the tunnels had learned their names.\n\nThe hum settled to a floor-note you only noticed when it stopped.\n\nIt stopped.\n\n\n\nDust lifted off the stone in slow spirals, then hung as if waiting to be told where to fall.\n\nVex's hand found the wall. \"Metallic again,\" she murmured. \"Coin on the tongue.\"\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words. Nothing more.\n\nSerana's wardline thinned to chalk-pale, then steadied.\n\nCaelin felt the scale tighten—warning without pain, the kind that comes just before it hurts.\n\nThe chamber ahead was the shape of a held breath.\n\nShadow clung to the facets and then decided to stand.\n\nFive of them—wrong-jointed, glass-slick, learning their limbs like newborns. They moved like puppets given too many strings. Joints bent a fraction wrong. Skin was the color of cold parchment, stretched and shifting over bones that didn't respect anatomy. Eyes were black from lid to lid—no iris, no white, just void that stared back.\n\nTheir shadows moved first, crawling toward Caelin's arm with hungry, fingered curiosity.\n\nWhen they spoke, three voices braided through each throat: the people they had been, something ancient and patient, and beneath both the grind of stone on stone.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" they said together. \"The Seal remembers. The Seal hungers.\"\n\n\"Line,\" Serana said, sword low. \"Light, then edges. No heroes.\"\n\nThornik palmed two charges. \"Edges I have. Heroes, sadly, I left at home.\"\n\n\"Left,\" Vex snapped, already moving.\n\n\"Right,\" Nyxara echoed, voice silk over wire.\n\nCaelin took center because the path in his bones put him there.\n\nThe scale's edge bloomed black-violet—ink spreading through obsidian water—and snapped back to red-gold. It hurt different this time: not the compressive burn of claiming, not the constant ache he could now ignore. This was a hook, barbed and patient, tugging along the filament lattice as if it could pull the Ember out of him with steady, surgical malice.\n\nHe staggered. Elowen caught his shoulder. \"I can sense it,\" she said, voice tight. \"A severing. I can't ease this.\"\n\n\"Then we break the hand holding the hook,\" Serana said, and ran.\n\nHe drew heat and starved it to a hard white seam across his palm, then cut the closest shadow at the ankle.\n\nIt shrieked in three registers and folded—but did not die.\n\nPain lit the scale a murderous red. He kept his hand closed anyway.\n\nSerana hit them like a wall of weather. Shield-first, a ward-wave plowing the nearest thrall backward so hard its shadow recoiled, hissing. Her sword came down in a clean kill-line—\n\nHer lips moved—automatic prayer, the kind learned in bone.\n\nThe answer struck from two mouths at once.\n\nProtect the flame.\n\nBreak the vessel to save the flame.\n\nHer wardlight guttered, flared, guttered. Blood salted her tongue.\n\n\"Choose,\" she hissed—to the voices, to herself. The blade came up anyway. \"Fine. I choose now.\"\n\nShe stepped in and set her sword through the thing's shoulder—and met resistance like cutting water that didn't agree to be cut. Light seared black flesh; it didn't fall. It grinned too wide—teeth blooming like fungus where a mouth should stop.\n\n\"Hard to kill!\" she called.\n\n\"News flash,\" Vex said, already gone from where she'd spoken.\n\n\"Duck,\" Thornik said, and rolled a thimble charge.\n\nIt coughed instead of boomed; the echo slapped the chamber flat.\n\nThe shadow's edge tore like wet paper where the sound hit it.\n\n\"Acoustic shear,\" he breathed. \"Repeatable.\"\n\nShe was a blur on the fringe: two quick stabs behind a knee and a tendon, twist and away. The thrall buckled correctly—then its shadow lashed like a whip and caught her across the ribs.\n\nVex hit stone, slid, swore without wasting air. \"Shadows bite! Noted!\"\n\nVex went low, a fast insult of steel at what passed for a heel. \"Trip the legs, quiet the mouth.\"\n\nNyxara didn't draw. She spoke a word that bent the lantern-angle; light arrived from the wrong direction.\n\nThe shadow flinched from illumination that shouldn't exist there.\n\n\"Transposition,\" she said, almost kindly. \"Stand in your proper place.\"\n\nThornik roared—a sound that came from under mountains—and hit the hamstrung thrall with two axes like punctuation. Steel met neck. Head rolled. Its shadow screamed like glass breaking underwater and blew away.\n\n\"One!\" he bellowed, beard alight with reflected ember.\n\nNyxara didn't shout. She breathed, and indecision bloomed in two corrupted minds. One raked at the wrong air where Caelin had stood; the other hesitated in a three-second loop of doubt.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, soft but absolute.\n\nSerana obliged. Silver-gold through the throat; the shadow boiled like ice in summer and was gone.\n\nThe fourth rose for Vex's throat.\n\nDurgan was there. No shout, no flourish—steel where it had to be. His forearm took the rake that would have opened her.\n\nHe shoved it back two steps and did not pursue.\n\nThe last turned from the fighters and stretched too many fingers toward Caelin.\n\n\"Ember-born,\" three voices purred. \"The chain is mercy. Let us hold your fire. We will take the pain away.\"\n\nThe scale chose.\n\nHeat flowered in his chest like a furnace door thrown wide. It wasn't temperature; it was pressure finding a path. His right arm lifted with a puppet's surety. Obsidian hex flared white. The lattice lit like molten wire from palm to collarbone.\n\nHe didn't aim. Didn't choose. The Ember chose him as an answer.\n\nRed-gold plasma ripped the air. Granite vitrified to glossy black where it touched. The smell hit hard—hot glass, burnt ozone, iron filings on the tongue.\n\nThe thrall didn't burn. It unmade. Flesh evaporated. Bone sifted to ash. The shadow screamed in three notes and was not.\n\nThree seconds. Then the door slammed shut.\n\nPain took the room.\n\nThe remaining shadows collapsed into behaving dark, dragging cold with them that wasn't temperature so much as absence.\n\nThey said nothing more. They only learned the shape of the group and thinned into the walls.\n\nSound returned in layers—first to the floor, then to the air, then, last of all, to breath.\n\nCaelin flexed scorched fingers. The scale tallied pain and settled to coal-glow.\n\nSound wavered, distant and too loud. His heart rattled a panicked rhythm. The plate in his arm dropped from white-hot to furious red, the filaments pulsing like infected seams. His lungs forgot how. He went to a knee on a floor that looked like a mirror still cooling.\n\nElowen was there, palms hovering. Green light reached for him—and guttered, the smell of scorched leaves sharp and wrong. A thin edge of one vine-mark blackened on her skin as she pulled back.\n\n\"I can't,\" she whispered, horrified. \"Post-cast residue burns my connection. I can ease your baseline, not this.\"\n\n\"S'okay,\" he managed through his teeth. \"You told me.\"\n\nVex slid in hard, fingers at his pulse, pupils, breath. \"Not dying,\" she said briskly. \"Shouldn't cast again for hours—maybe a day—unless we want him to.\" She made a leveling motion with her hand. \"You know.\"\n\nHer joke was a little too thin to be a joke. He almost laughed anyway.\n\nSerana kept her hand on the ward until it stopped shaking. When she finally sheathed the blade, her mouth was set against words.\n\nVex wiped her knife clean and didn't thank Durgan. She didn't not thank him, either.\n\nNyxara smoothed her coat as if dirt were an opinion, then watched Serana a fraction too long.\n\nThornik counted fuses he hadn't used and grinned like a man who'd just learned his math could kill.\n\nHe glanced at Caelin’s arm—coal-glow again, the ember-motes drifting slow. “Back to baseline,” he said, as if noting a reading. “Coal means steady. Ember-red means spent. Black-violet means—” He stopped himself. “Well. We know what black-violet means.”\n\nAt the mouth of the passage, Durgan hadn't moved an inch. He kept the retreat open, blades ready—eyes trained not on the dark beyond, but on the lattice burning under Caelin's skin. His shadow flexed like a dog that had caught a scent. He flattened it with will and left crescent bruises through his trousers where his fingers anchored him.\n\nThe hum returned, deeper, almost pleased.\n\n\"Not a voice,\" Caelin said, listening to the stone. \"Not yet.\"",

Her jaw tightened. \"No. Not with a beacon on two legs. I hate the idea, but... containment.\"\n\n\"The Undervault,\" Thornik offered, already pulling the battered journal from his coat. Pages crackled, stained with old blood and older ink. \"Pre-Concord passages. Old dwarf-wards. My grandfather mapped entries and marked the Deep Hall. Wards there might confuse whatever is sniffing us.\"\n\n\"Safer for civilians,\" Serana said, jaw set. \"Not for us.\"\n\nElowen's gaze went inward, the way it did when she listened to the Weave. The green of her tattoos pulsed faintly, then dimmed. \"The deep places are hurt. Wounded things can be generous. Or angry.\"\n\nDurgan's fingers twitched toward a blade, then away—a motion so fast only Vex caught it. \"Safer to be hunted in stone than among farms.\"\n\nThey looked to Caelin.\n\nThe scale warmed—not push, not pull. Waiting.\n\nHe thought of Thornwick. Of glass bones where houses had stood. Of Mira's small hand clutching his ruined cloak.\n\n\"Undervault,\" he said. \"We don't bring this down to doorsteps.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" Thornik said, already shouldering weight, adjusting straps with practiced efficiency. \"I've always wanted to risk my life on decayed ventilation and ancestral pride.\"\n\n\"Lead on,\" Vex said, checking her daggers with methodical precision. \"If a ward eats us, I'm haunting you.\"\n\n\"Queue forms to the left,\" Thornik said, finding his cheer again despite everything. \"Ancestral disapproval is first-come, first-served.\"",

                "text": "ACT III: THE CHASM CHOIR\n\nThornik found the seam in the wall by feel—three high, two low, one center—and an ancient hinge sighed cold air into their faces. The breath of the Undervault tasted of iron, dust, and old smoke that had forgotten its fire.\n\nA tight spiral took them down past shelves of fossilized lichen that glowed just enough to make shadows mean. The scale's coal-glow mixed with green-blue, turning everything a strange bruised purple. Their boots found perfect dwarf-cut treads, each one precisely placed, worn smooth by centuries of use. Breath plumed in the cold.\n\nThey came to a three-way junction.\n\nThornik thumbed brittle pages, following his grandfather's diagrams with one finger while holding his lantern close. \"Left is sealed. Collapse, bad air, and a page of do not in runes only grandmothers use.\" He squinted at faded ink. \"Right's toward the forges—likely flooded. Straight is the Deep Hall. Strongest wards. Multiple exits.\"\n\n\"'Should be' is the most dangerous phrase,\" Vex muttered, testing the air currents with a wetted finger.\n\n\"Aye,\" Thornik said cheerfully. \"Shall we?\"\n\nThey walked until silence felt heavier than noise.\n\nThe mountain had gone from predator to cathedral—huge, patient, and indifferent.\n\nEvery sound came back doubled, as if the tunnels were practicing conversation.\n\nBy the time they moved again, their footsteps felt borrowed.\n\nThe bridge waited with the patience of stone made to sing.\n\nBelow, the dark had depth—thick enough to hold a choir.\n\n\"Single file,\" Serana said, testing the first plank with her boot. \"Slow. No idle noise.\"\n\nThornik swallowed a theory about resonant architecture. Vex swallowed a curse about trusting ancient engineering.\n\nDurgan said nothing and stepped where he was told.\n\nThe first footfall rang a low bell—pure, round, unhurried.\n\nThe second answered a third below, like harmony remembering itself.\n\nBy Caelin's fourth step the bells had learned his weight and offered a scale that climbed in perfect intervals.\n\nThe plate in his arm kept time despite him, pulsing in rhythm with the bells—coal-glow brightening fractionally with each step.\n\nHalfway across, Nyxara's heel grazed a loose shard.\n\nThe note that answered came bent, then split into two, then four—ugly, eager, dissonant.\n\nThe span trembled. Cracks webbed outward from where her foot had landed, then held—barely.\n\n\"Don't improvise,\" Vex hissed without turning, knuckles white on the rope.\n\n\"Tragic,\" Nyxara said, adjusting her footing with careful precision. \"I excel at it.\"\n\nFrom the chasm rose an answering chord—soft at first, then full enough to live in. Harmonics layered upon harmonics, building a cathedral of sound in the empty air.\n\nElowen's eyes went wide. \"Roots sing under storms,\" she whispered. \"This isn't that.\"\n\nThornik's hand hovered over his tuning fork, then curled to a fist. \"This is engineered. Intentional. The entire bridge is an instrument.\"\n\nCaelin tasted metal and old ash. The scale warmed without pain, as if listening back, recognizing something in the music.\n\nThey reached a split in the span: two narrow runs diverging for ten feet before rejoining, creating a gap where no single person could span both paths.\n\n\"Pairs, or it drops us,\" Thornik said, staring at the bell spacing carved into each path. \"It wants balance, not mass. Weight distribution.\"\n\n\"Vex with Nyxara,\" Serana ordered, already assessing. \"Thornik with me. Caelin in the center. Durgan anchors.\"\n\nVex clicked her tongue. \"You do love a trust exercise.\"\n\nNyxara smiled. \"I adore being trusted.\"\n\nDurgan took the rear without comment, his shadow pooling perfectly still despite the chasm wind.\n\nThe twin paths learned their pairs fast—two notes for each step, tuned just off a perfect fifth. When Serana's breath hitched mid-crossing, her note wavered. The bridge shuddered.\n\n\"Hold,\" Caelin said—more plea than order.\n\nShe held. The bells forgave her, the dissonance resolving back to harmony.\n\nA hairline seam opened under Vex's foot without warning.\n\nShe didn't scream; she vanished down to the knee, fingers scrabbling for purchase. Her knife hand caught stone, blade sinking into a crack with desperate precision.\n\nNyxara didn't reach for her. She changed the angle of her shadow with a subtle gesture, fingers tracing sigils in the air.\n\nFor one breath, light came from the wrong direction; the stone remembered being whole. The seam closed just enough.\n\nVex kicked free, hauled up with trembling arms, swore once—the rare, sincere kind that meant actual fear.\n\nBehind them Durgan's note didn't change. He hadn't moved. Hadn't even shifted his weight.\n\nThe last bell rang itself when Caelin stepped off the stone, a final perfect tone that lingered in the air long after it should have faded.\n\nAhead, the corridor opened into a dome vast enough to hold weather.\n\nNine pillars ringed the space, each cut with a different pattern of facets that caught light and swallowed it. They didn't glow. They absorbed.\n\nThe quiet here was thicker than dark.\n\n\"Resonant sink,\" Thornik breathed, voice dropping to a whisper instinctively. \"It drinks sound.\"\n\n\"Then whisper,\" Vex said. \"Or think louder than you speak.\"\n\nSerana's wardlight dimmed to a candle's stubborn core. \"This place keeps oaths. Or breaks them.\"\n\nNyxara walked the nearest pillar, fingertip hovering, never touching. \"Nine doors that forgot they were doors.\"\n\n\"The pull's stronger,\" Durgan said. Three words. Nothing more.\n\nThe plate brightened from coal to ember.\n\nNot pain—attendance.\n\nCaelin laid two fingers against the nearest pillar. It did not warm. It did not sing.\n\nIt remembered a heat so old the stone no longer called it heat.\n\nIn that heartbeat he saw a hand not his own pressing this same facet; a voice not his own saying a name he didn't know how to repeat. The vision smelled of forge-fire and ozone, tasted of copper and purpose.\n\nHe pulled back. Taste of copper. Taste of thunder about to happen.\n\n\"I think it knows the order,\" he said. \"I don't.\"\n\nA note rose from somewhere beneath the dome—lower than any bell on the span, the kind that rearranges ribs and makes bones remember they're temporary.\n\nThe nine pillars answered by not answering. Each drank the sound and gave back silence, creating a void where the note should have echoed.\n\n\"Echoes below,\" Thornik said, instruments beginning to hum in sympathy.\n\n\"Not echoes,\" Elowen murmured, one hand pressed to her sternum as if feeling the vibration there. \"Something that expects us.\"\n\nThey stood in the quiet a moment longer, counting breaths they hadn't meant to hold.\n\nThen the pull in Caelin's arm tightened, and the path chose left.",

                "text": "ACT IV: DEEP HALL\n\nThe Deep Hall opened not gradually, but all at once—as if a cathedral of stone had been hiding an arm's length beyond the dark.\n\nPillars like old oaks rose from an obsidian floor polished to mirror. Bas-reliefs coiled up each: dwarves and dragons working side by side; forges burning in colors metal shouldn't make; the nine pedestals carved and blessed, each one distinct in its geometry. At the crown of every pillar, chains looped around a shape no artist would define—something that might have been a lock, or a heart, or both.\n\nAlong the walls, nine alcoves expressed their schools in stone:\n\nEvocation: facets that multiplied light until it looked like heat, angular and aggressive.\n\nAbjuration: nested bevels, each guarding the next in concentric protection.\n\nConjuration: empty arches promising somewhere else, frames without destinations.\n\nDivination: spirals your eyes couldn't follow without falling, probability made geometry.\n\nEnchantment: curves that made attention lean, seductive and subtle.\n\nIllusion: surfaces that adjusted when you didn't look, never quite the same twice.\n\nNecromancy: a hollow; an absence; a worn edge where something used to be.\n\nTransmutation: rough stone flowing to glass mid-surface, frozen mid-change.\n\nDestruction: edges broken on purpose to prove a point, jagged and defiant.\n\nIn the center, a round granite table big enough for a parliament. Dust softened the shine. No footprints but theirs.\n\n\"The wards held,\" Thornik breathed, watching his scanner's needles settle to a calm green. \"Active peace. Saints and stone—this place is safe.\"\n\nSerana still paced the perimeter—old habits dying hard. Her light swept high vaults and alcoves; nothing moved but breath and dust motes dancing in the ward-glow. Vex tested for pressure plates out of reflex, found none. Elowen's voice came out as reverent as prayer. \"Stone remembers bargains.\"\n\nDurgan paused at the threshold. The carved runes flickered—curious, then tolerant. \"Uncomfortable,\" he said honestly, and crossed. His shadow tried to widen past his boots; the ward-light nudged it back like a shepherd dog redirecting wayward sheep. He set his jaw. It obeyed.\n\n\"We rest,\" Serana decided. \"Pairs on watch. No solos.\"\n\nThey burned a small, clean fire in a shallow stone cradle with invisible vents—Thornik tapped the pillar and grinned: \"We make smoke go where we want. Grandfather's diagrams called this 'breathstone.' Channels run through the walls.\"\n\nThe air tasted faintly of oil and old ash; fresher scents—leather, metal polish, juniper from a scrap of kindling—cut through the mineral cold.\n\nThey ate dried meat and hard cheese. They checked steel, adjusted straps, cleaned blades. They didn't talk much at first.\n\nCaelin sat with his back to a pillar beneath Evocation, watching the facets multiply the firelight into something that looked almost like the flames he carried. The scale had cooled to its steady coal-glow; the constant ache was back—the kind Elowen could ease when it wasn't fresh-burn. He flexed his hand. The lattice answered, not offended, not appeased. You'll know when you can pay again, it seemed to say.\n\nHe hoped his body would warn him before his bone-marrow did.\n\n\n\nFirst Watch: Caelin & Vex\n\nThey kept it simple: steel on knees, backs to stone, ears tuned to the empty halls. The scale pulsed with his heart, ember drifting like slow fish under dark glass.\n\n\"That thing is you now,\" Vex said, not unkind, studying the plate where it lay flush in his skin. \"Optional to like it. Not optional to learn it.\"\n\nHe huffed a laugh. \"It calls me out when I lie. When anyone does.\" He nodded at his arm. \"White spark. Like thorns under the skin.\"\n\n\"Handy and infuriating.\" She studied him with those mismatched eyes. \"For what it's worth—you didn't hesitate when it acted. Courage or stupidity.\"\n\n\"Which do you vote?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She eased a breath around her ribs, wincing slightly. \"Brave people do stupid things with better reasons.\"\n\n\"And you joke so you don't scream.\"\n\n\"Don't get romantic. Joking also annoys monsters.\"\n\nThe scale stayed quiet. Truth accepted.\n\nThey sat in companionable silence after that, listening to the fire pop and the mountain breathe.\n\n\n\nSecond Watch: Serana & Thornik\n\nSerana's hands rested in prayer form, fingers laced. No words came. Her lips moved occasionally but made no sound. Thornik pretended to tune his scanner while watching her not-pray.\n\n\"Still split?\" he asked gently after a long silence.\n\n\"Protect yesterday. Sacrifice today.\" Her mouth crooked, humorless. \"I can follow orders. I cannot follow contradictions.\"\n\n\"In a good system, contradictions signal a changed input.\" He tapped his grandfather's journal. \"He wrote: Balance isn't the absence of cost. It's paying without bankrupting the world.\"\n\n\"Doesn't make it easier.\"\n\n\"No,\" Thornik said softly. \"But it makes it necessary.\"\n\nHer light flickered gold→silver→gold again; she steadied it with a breath and nodded, accepting the truth if not the comfort of it.\n\nThey sat watching the shadows dance on ancient carvings, and neither spoke of the weight they carried.\n\n\n\nThird Watch: Nyxara & Elowen\n\nSilence sat between them like a cat that owned the room.\n\n\"Your magic is... angled,\" Elowen said at last, breaking the quiet.\n\n\"So is yours,\" Nyxara replied, head tilted with feline curiosity. \"Yours bends toward growth and cycles. Mine bends toward... consent, of a kind.\"\n\n\"Do you trust it?\"\n\n\"Trust implies parity.\" A small, tired smile. \"I honor the bargains I make.\"\n\n\"I'm losing ground,\" Elowen said softly, touching the edge of the blackened vine-mark with careful fingers. \"When he casts, I can't help. I burn.\"\n\n\"Then plan for loss,\" Nyxara said. Not cruel. Precise. \"Decide who you are when the Weave doesn't answer.\"\n\nElowen looked at the Necromancy alcove without fear, studying the hollow where something had been carved away. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Decide anyway.\"\n\nA frost halo settled on Nyxara's lashes for a heartbeat and melted, leaving tiny droplets like tears that weren't.\n\nElowen noticed. Said nothing.\n\n\n\nFourth Watch: Durgan (breaking the pair rule)\n\nHe took the arch alone and didn't wake the person assigned to him. Not defiance—necessity. When he slept, his shadow got ideas.\n\nHe kept it small, neat, obedient by force, the way you keep your breathing even under a predator's gaze. The scale's distant glow tugged at his periphery like a road that always slopes downward, whispering promises in a language he refused to learn.\n\nWalk away, a voice inside offered. Lose yourself in the dark. Stop being a danger.\n\nHe didn’t. Instead he squeezed four half-moons into his thigh through wool and felt the pain anchor him. Added four more next to the earlier set, a constellation of control etched in bruises.\n\nHis shadow moved anyway.\n\nNot far—an inch, maybe two, stretching toward the coal-glow at the edge of Caelin’s bedroll. He caught it the moment he felt the resistance ease, snapped it back with a breath so sharp it hurt his chest, and held it there. It obeyed. Barely.\n\nHe made reaching boring. Made it cost. But it had moved on its own, and they both knew it.\n\n\"How long,\" he thought, not asking anyone, \"before I can't hold it still?\"\n\nThe ward-lines along the threshold pulsed once—assessing, not judging. They recognized restraint when they saw it.\n\nHe didn't move.",

                "text": "ACT V: THE LONG ASCENT\n\nCaelin woke to a sound his bones recognized before his mind did.\n\nThud.\n\nNot weather. Not rockfall. The counting of something chained far below.\n\nThe scale answered with a brighter coal-glow; ember drift quickened inside the obsidian. Around the circle, heads lifted one by one. The sound came again, nearer—or just more focused, as if attention had turned their direction.\n\nThud-thud-thud-thud—\n\nThornik's needles jittered from calm green to anxious yellow. \"Movement. Multiple. Below us. Above us. Possibly... through us?\"\n\n\"Any other good news?\" Vex asked, already on her feet, daggers appearing in her hands.\n\n\"The ventilation is superb,\" Thornik said, shouldering his pack with practiced speed. \"And I'm very attached to my head.\"\n\nFrom the three corridors—the sealed, the flooded, the safe—stone began to move. Grinding. Opening. The air drew a breath that wasn't theirs.\n\nSerana rose fully armored, sword in hand, voice calm to keep the pulse down in others. \"We move now. Thornik on point. Same formation. If a ward asks for courtesy, we give it. If something tries to herd us—\"\n\n\"We bite the hand,\" Vex said, rolling a shoulder and wincing as her ribs protested. \"Then run.\"\n\nCaelin stood. The ache was a live thing in his bones. Elowen's palm hovered near his arm—she tested the air for fresh-burn and found none. Relief drifted in like cool rain; the pain stepped back a pace, manageable again. He swallowed gratitude, because speaking it would make it real, and he didn't know how many more times he'd get it.\n\nDurgan slid to rear-guard. His shadow pooled obedi—\n\nNo. It pressed at the edges like tide against a seawall. He smoothed it with breath and didn't look at Caelin, didn't acknowledge the way it wanted to reach toward the coal-glow in the dark.\n\nNyxara passed the Evocation alcove and paused for a heartbeat, head tilted. The scale gave a silver shimmer—a brief halo that said another magic is looking back. She smiled to herself and moved on.\n\nThey stepped toward the straight corridor. Behind them, in the polished seal of the Deep Hall's floor, their reflections delayed by a single blink—there, then gone, as if the stone was deciding whether to remember them.\n\nThe heartbeat below picked up, counting them like beads on a string.\n\nThey went up.\n\n\n\nThey moved quickly after that, not running—no one wanted to find out what would give chase—but with the shared precision of people who'd heard a door close behind them and didn't know whose house they were in.\n\nThe tunnels felt steeper on the way out, as if the mountain had grown new muscles while they weren't watching. Gravity pulled harder, or perhaps exhaustion made it feel that way.\n\nWalls that had been smooth now carried shallow grooves—fresh, unfinished work, stone still warm under fingertips that brushed too close.\n\nThornik muttered calculations under his breath, consulting his instruments. \"Stress fractures don't self-heal. Something's rewriting geology.\"\n\nVex: \"Tell it to stop.\"\n\n\"Would if I knew the syntax.\"\n\n\"Try screaming louder.\"\n\nShe smiled. No one else did.\n\nAt the first junction they hit a dead end that hadn't existed before. The floor sloped upward in a spiral of newly-cooled glass, the surface too perfect to be natural, too warm to be old.\n\nSerana touched the seam where new met old. \"It's sealing itself behind us.\"\n\nNyxara looked at the closing curve, studying it with professional interest. \"Or ahead of us. Perspective is the first casualty of divine architecture.\"\n\nCaelin set his palm against the wall; the scale pulsed once—recognition, not alarm. \"It's guiding, not trapping.\"\n\n\"Comforting,\" Vex said, checking over her shoulder at the way they'd come. \"Until it stops.\"\n\nThe second tunnel forked into shadow. A draft hissed through like breath through teeth, carrying the smell of deep earth and older dark.\n\nSerana drew light. It came thin and trembling, barely enough to push back the shadows.\n\nShe tried again. The radiance stuttered, guttered, and went out like a candle in wind.\n\n\"I... can't feel the source.\" Her voice was calm because she'd trained it\n\nto be, but her hand shook slightly before she lowered it.\n\nNyxara's reply was all sugar. \"You're running on faith, darling. Check your reserves.\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Caelin's tone cut sharper than intended. The warmth of the scale spilled into his voice, unasked. \"She's tired, not empty.\"\n\nSerana looked at him—really looked—and he saw in her eyes the flicker of gratitude and shame tangled together like roots and chains.\n\n\"I'll manage.\"\n\nShe didn't.\n\nThey climbed a narrow chute where the roof had already dropped its first warning stones—small ones, pebbles that clattered down like dice announcing the mountain's intentions.\n\nThornik went first, hammering pitons into half-molten rock with steady, practiced strikes. Each blow echoed differently, telling him what the stone would hold and what it wouldn't.\n\nHalfway up, the air shifted—pressure collapse, no sound, just a sudden absence—then the wall shuddered.\n\nCaelin felt the pull in his arm flare white-hot. \"Move!\"\n\nThey ran on instinct. The rear half of the tunnel folded inward, stone sighing like something exhaling dust and disappointment. Rock met rock with the sound of finality, sealing the way they'd come.\n\nWhen the noise settled, the way back was gone.\n\nThornik stared at the new wall, panting. \"Correction: rewriting geology in real time.\"\n\nVex pressed her hand against the fresh barrier. Still warm. \"So we go forward or we stay here until we're decoration.\"\n\n\"Forward,\" Serana said, voice steady though her light had guttered out entirely. \"Always forward.\"\n\nThe climb stole what little rhythm remained in their breathing.\n\nCaelin's right arm ached with the memory of the sigils—hot where the rest of him was cold. The filaments crawled beneath his skin like they were searching for something they'd lost.\n\nElowen fell into step beside him without being asked. \"You're shaking.\"\n\n\"It's the pull.\"\n\n\"Then push back.\"\n\nHe managed a half-laugh. \"That easy?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"But start somewhere.\"\n\nShe brushed her hand near his sleeve; the ache dulled. Not gone—just bearable. The green of her tattoos flickered, dimmed slightly, another small price paid.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Later,\" she said. \"When we're out.\"\n\nBehind them Nyxara glanced at Durgan's shadow—still too obedient, too smooth, like a dog trained to sit perfectly still while its master walked away.\n\n\"You hear it too?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"The hum?\"\n\nHe shook his head once. \"Footsteps.\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. Didn't look at her. Just kept walking with that deliberate, measured pace that suggested if he stopped, he might not start again.\n\nWhen she looked again, his shadow was holding perfectly still while his boots moved—a fraction too much control, the kind that comes from fighting something every single second.\n\nAt last the tunnel widened enough for rest.\n\nThornik struck a flame that barely caught, nursing it like a dying thing. The light painted their faces in ochre and exhaustion, hollowing cheeks and deepening shadows.\n\nVex divided rations without asking; she had counted before anyone noticed they were running low. Dried meat, harder cheese, a swallow of water each. She moved with the efficiency of someone who'd learned hunger as a child and never forgotten the lesson.\n\nSerana knelt apart, tracing the sigil of her order in ash on the ground. The mark wouldn't hold shape. The dust slid away from her fingers as if the mountain itself rejected the prayer. She tried again. Again the ash refused her.\n\nCaelin watched but didn't interrupt.\n\nSome prayers, he thought, were best left unanswered.\n\nA faint tremor moved through the stone like a muscle tensing.\n\nTheir gear jingled once, softly.\n\nThen the hum changed key—dropping a full tone, deeper, more present.\n\nThornik's head snapped up. \"That's not us.\"\n\nElowen closed her eyes, listening with her whole body the way trees listen to approaching storms. \"Something old is turning over in its sleep.\"\n\nVex sheathed her knife slow, deliberate. \"Let's not be the alarm clock.\"\n\nThey climbed the last stretch in silence.\n\nSnowlight filtered down from a crack above—thin, colorless, precious as air. The temperature dropped with every step, breath turning to visible ghosts in the suddenly frigid air.\n\nWhen they emerged onto open rock, the air hit like resurrection: cold, clean, cruelly bright after so long in the dark.\n\nCaelin turned back once. The tunnel mouth had already begun to glass over, edges smoothing and sealing, faintly glowing from within with a light that pulsed in time with the distant counting below.\n\nHe couldn't tell if it was sealing itself shut or lighting a path back.\n\nEither way, it watched them go.\n\n\"The mountain remembers,\" Elowen whispered. \"Question is—what?\"",

                "text": "ACT VI: THE SUMMIT'S SHADOW\n\nWind met them like a blade honed on snow.\n\nThe world was all angles—black rock, white glare, a sky so close it felt like a lid pressing down on the peaks.\n\nBreath came thin and loud in their own ears, each inhalation a small victory against the altitude.\n\nThe ridge ran like a spine, dropping to glazed couloirs on either side—sheets of ice that fell away into clouds and nothing. One wrong step and gravity would have opinions.\n\nFar ahead, the flame-path in Caelin's vision brightened to a fine wire, then split along the crest—two threads, left and lower, right and steep.\n\nHe blinked; the right-hand thread tugged harder. Not safer. Just certain. The kind of certainty that didn't care about safety.\n\n\"Two ways,\" he said.\n\n\"Then there's only one,\" Vex answered, already squinting into the glare, reading the terrain with the practiced eye of someone who'd survived by always choosing the less-bad option.\n\nSunlight cut through high cloud and made three mock-suns at the horizon—halos stacked like coins, a parhelion that shouldn't have been so clear at this time of day.\n\nFor a moment the middle ring threw nine spokes across the glare, a trick of ice crystals and angle.\n\nThey watched until the spokes thinned and died, melting back into ordinary light.\n\n\"Pretty,\" Thornik said, too softly. \"I hate it.\"\n\n\"Atmospheric phenomenon,\" Vex said. \"Ice crystals refracting—\"\n\n\"I know what it is,\" Thornik interrupted. \"Doesn't make it less ominous.\"\n\n\"Light for the edge,\" Serana said, lifting a hand as they prepared to traverse the exposed ridge.\n\nNothing came.\n\nShe breathed, steadied, tried again. The wardline stuttered and guttered like breath caught in a throat, flickering silver-gold-silver before dying completely.\n\n\"Source is... thin,\" she said, voice even by force of will. \"Can't hold it.\"\n\nNyxara's smile didn't travel to her eyes. \"Altitude does that to certainty.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Caelin said—quieter than anger, firmer than plea. \"We move slow. No miracles, just rope.\"\n\nSerana nodded once and lowered her hand. That, too, was a kind of prayer—accepting limitation, working within it.\n\nThey roped in—Thornik's knots neat as script, each one tested twice. Vex testing every anchor with insults and physics, trusting neither completely.\n\nThe ridge narrowed to two boot-widths and a faith wider than comfort.\n\nDurgan took rear without comment. He walked like a man who had been here in other lifetimes and found the drop repetitive. His shadow stayed small, obedient, costly.\n\nHalfway across, a gust hit sideways—a wall of wind with malice in it. Elowen's heel skated on rime; Caelin felt the rope jar tight across his chest, fibers groaning.\n\n\"Lean in,\" he said, not sure who needed it. Maybe himself.\n\nThey did. The gust passed. The ridge became a ridge again.\n\nNyxara altered the angle of her shadow with a single, almost lazy wrist-turn—subtle magic, barely noticeable.\n\nFor one breath the glare softened where their eyes needed it most, giving them a moment of relief from the sun-blindness.\n\nVex saw it and didn't comment. She only moved faster, wanting to be off the exposed spine before the mountain changed its mind.\n\n\"Shelter,\" Durgan said, three heartbeats later.\n\nNot warning. A direction.\n\nThey followed his chin-tilt to a bite taken out of the lee side—a snow-scooped alcove backed by stone, protected from the worst of the wind.\n\nThey crouched out of the wind, bodies grateful for even this small mercy. Fire was a joke up here where oxygen barely existed; Thornik didn't try. They huddled together for warmth instead.\n\nSerana sat with her back to rock and closed her eyes like someone setting down a weight too heavy to carry any longer.\n\nCaelin heard the whisper before he saw her jaw tighten—the overlapping threads of two instructions that would never agree, playing in an endless loop.\n\nProtect the flame.\n\nOffer the bearer.\n\nHer fingers found the chalk tucked in her belt and snapped it cleanly in two. The pieces fell into the snow and were immediately buried by a fresh gust.\n\n\"I can walk,\" she said, eyes still shut. \"I can't promise more.\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Caelin answered.\n\nHe didn't add, For now.\n\nVex distributed a stingy fistful of dried fruit as if paying out wages. \"Don't die; I'll have to redo headcount.\"\n\nThornik chewed slowly, trying not to look at the halos still staining the horizon like cosmic warning signs. \"Quantitatively speaking, we're under-supplied on miracles.\"\n\nNyxara watched the way the wind curled around Caelin's forearm, as if the air had opinions about ownership. \"Quantitatively speaking,\" she murmured, \"we're over-supplied on audience.\"\n\nDurgan didn't sit. His shadow behaved itself. That felt like a decision that cost him.\n\nThe ridge underfoot hummed—two notes a tone apart, beating slow against each other in a rhythm that made teeth ache.\n\nThornik touched stone with a bare palm. \"That's not weather.\"\n\nElowen listened with her whole body, the way she'd learned to read the forest's moods. \"Something turned over below us.\"\n\n\"Left,\" Caelin said. The pull in his arm was no longer a suggestion. It was a command.\n\nNo one argued.\n\nThey moved into a light that felt older than noon, shadows stretching wrong directions, the sun pale and distant.\n\nThe mock-suns had faded, but the taste of metal hadn't—copper and ozone, the flavor of lightning about to strike.\n\nBehind them, the wind erased their prints in a single pass, as if the mountain wanted no record they'd been there.\n\nAhead, the path narrowed and began to sing—a low, thrumming note that rose from stone or sky or the space between.\n\nSerana opened her hand for light one more time and found none. She closed it before anyone saw, fingers curling into a fist.\n\nBut Caelin saw. And said nothing.\n\nBefore they moved, Vex ran her count aloud—four charges spent, one blade chipped, three wounds that needed proper dressing when there was time. Thornik tapped the scale of remaining fuses against his thigh: six left. Elowen said nothing, but turned one wrist up; two more vine-marks had darkened at the edges, thin black lines where the green should have been. Serana’s wardlight was gone and hadn’t come back.\n\nCaelin looked at his arm. Coal-glow. Steady. Not spent, not surging—just present.\n\n“Still here,” he said, to no one in particular.\n\nThey descended.",
